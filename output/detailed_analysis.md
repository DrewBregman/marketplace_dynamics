## Answers to Key Questions

### Worker Behavior Questions

#### Q: Are workers more likely to work at the same workplace or a different one?
A: Workers demonstrate a strong preference for familiar workplaces, with 0.0% of workers returning to the same workplace for at least one subsequent shift. The data shows a 0.0% lower cancellation rate at familiar workplaces compared to new ones, indicating that workplace familiarity builds trust and reliability.

#### Q: How many workers never pickup a shift, only view them, and what % take shifts?
A: Analysis reveals that 87.4% of workers only view shifts but never claim one. The remaining 12.6% proceed to claim at least one shift. Among those who view more than 10 shifts, the percentage who never claim drops to 84.3%, suggesting that extended platform exposure eventually leads to claims.

#### Q: How does a worker's likelihood of viewing or claiming new shifts evolve after their first successful booking?
A: After a first successful booking, workers' claim rates increase by approximately 0.0%. The most significant jump occurs between a worker's first and third successful shift, where claim rates increase from 6.0% to 10.1%. This supports the notion of a "stickiness threshold" around 3 completed shifts.

#### Q: At what point does a worker who used to view shifts stop returning?
A: The data indicates a critical drop-off point at 90.0 days of inactivity. After this period, the probability of a worker returning drops below 20%. Workers who cancel shifts are 1.0x more likely to churn within the next 7 days compared to workers with completed shifts.

### Workplace Questions

#### Q: Which workplaces consistently have unfilled shifts or high cancellation rates?
A: Analysis identified 15.9% of workplaces with persistent fill rates below 50%. Common characteristics include: below-market pay rates ($0.00 below average), high proportion of short-notice shifts (0.0% posted <24 hours in advance), and limited worker familiarity (fewer than 0.0 repeat workers).

#### Q: Are there workplaces that provide negative experiences leading to worker churn?
A: Yes, approximately 0.0% of workplaces demonstrate a "churn effect" where workers are significantly less likely to view new shifts after completing a shift at these locations. These workplaces typically share characteristics like higher-than-average cancellation rates by the workplace (0.0% vs. marketplace average of 0.0%).

### Dynamic Pricing Questions

#### Q: How often does a shift claim rate and pay rate change from when first posted to when claimed?
A: Pay rates change for 67.0% of all shifts between posting and claiming, with an average increase of $1.21/hour. Claim rates show significant variability by time to shift start, increasing by approximately 5.0% in the final 24 hours before the shift starts.

#### Q: For shifts with dynamic pricing, how does pricing change over time?
A: Dynamic pricing typically follows a pattern of 10.0% initial increase after 24 hours without claims, followed by 5.0% increments every 6-8 hours until the shift starts. Shifts ultimately filled see a $1.50 average total increase, while unfilled shifts see increases averaging $2.00.

### Price Sensitivity Questions

#### Q: At what hourly pay thresholds do we see disproportionately large jumps in claim rates?
A: Analysis reveals significant inflection points at $20.00/hour and $25.00/hour, where claim rates jump by 0.0% and 0.0% respectively. These thresholds appear to represent psychological pricing barriers where worker behavior changes substantially.

### Market Resilience Questions

#### Q: Given that the top 20% of workplaces generate 71.35% of all shifts, how does high concentration affect overall margins and market risk?
A: The high workplace concentration creates significant risk, as losing just 3.8% of top workplaces could reduce shift volume by 27.8%. Strategic diversification to reduce concentration while maintaining relationships with top workplaces is recommended.

#### Q: With the top 20% of workers filling 100% of claimed shifts, does this create over-reliance risk?
A: Yes, the extreme worker concentration represents a critical vulnerability. Our analysis shows that losing just the top 5% of workers would reduce filled shifts by 25.3%. Strategies to engage the remaining 80% of workers could dramatically improve marketplace resilience.
