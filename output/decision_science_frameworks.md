# Decision Science Frameworks: Optimizing Marketplace Decisions

Below are structured decision frameworks for key marketplace decision areas (Pricing, Supply Growth, Demand Growth, Product Optimization, Operational, and Strategic Initiatives). Each framework is organized as follows:

1. Decision Objective  
2. Key Inputs  
3. Decision Criteria  
4. Tradeoff Management  
5. Implementation Guide  

Throughout, we reference relevant marketplace insights (e.g., fill rates, peak vs. off-peak hours, worker/workplace concentrations, and retention metrics).

## 1. Pricing Decisions

### 1.1 Base Rate Determination
1. **Decision Objective**  
   - Establish an optimal baseline rate for shifts (hourly or per-shift) that maximizes fill rate while maintaining cost-effectiveness and worker satisfaction.
2. **Key Inputs**  
   - Historical fill-rate data by shift type, region, and time of day (aggregated by shift_id).  
   - Average local wages or competitor benchmarking.  
   - Worker satisfaction surveys or Net Promoter Score (NPS).  
   - Retention rates (~87% average).  
3. **Decision Criteria**  
   - Minimum viable rate to attract sufficient supply (workers) based on historical fill rates.  
   - Market-competitive wage thresholds.  
   - Segment-specific cost constraints (e.g., budget-limited workplaces vs. higher-paying workplaces).  
4. **Tradeoff Management**  
   - Higher base rate can improve fill rate but reduces margin for the marketplace or raises cost for workplaces.  
   - Too low a base rate might reduce fill rate, increase time-to-fill, and compromise worker retention.  
   - Strike balance by testing small rate increments and measuring fill rate changes over time.  
5. **Implementation Guide**  
   - Periodically benchmark local wage data to update a recommended baseline.  
   - Use a pilot test with a small subset of workplaces to measure the impact of a new baseline.  
   - Incorporate feedback loops (e.g., worker retention or fill-rate dips) to adjust base rates.  

### 1.2 Dynamic Pricing Adjustments
1. **Decision Objective**  
   - Continuously adjust pricing in real time to reflect evolving supply-demand conditions (e.g., day of week, shift times).  
2. **Key Inputs**  
   - Real-time supply-demand forecasts per region/time-slot (including historical claim rates like Saturday 3.74%).  
   - Worker accept/decline patterns and speed-to-claim metrics.  
   - Shift-level aggregator data ensuring multiple offers are not double-counted.  
3. **Decision Criteria**  
   - Threshold fill rate (e.g., 95% within 24 hours).  
   - Price elasticity of workers (assessed by how rate changes alter speed-to-claim).  
   - Workplace budget sensitivity.  
4. **Tradeoff Management**  
   - Setting dynamic prices too high may deter demand from cost-conscious workplaces.  
   - Setting dynamic prices too low may cause insufficient worker supply or unprofitable shifts.  
   - Must balance fill time, fill rate, and workplace cost satisfaction.  
5. **Implementation Guide**  
   - Implement an automated pricing algorithm that adjusts rate based on fill progress (e.g., an incremental rate bump if shifts aren’t claimed in X hours).  
   - Define guardrails (min-max prices) to stay within budget acceptance thresholds.  
   - Regularly analyze claim rate vs. price changes to refine algorithm parameters.  

### 1.3 Incentive Structure Decisions
1. **Decision Objective**  
   - Offer targeted incentives (e.g., sign-up bonuses, shift completion bonuses) that improve fill rates and worker retention.  
2. **Key Inputs**  
   - Worker churn data (30-day churn definition and ~87% retention).  
   - Worker concentration insights (top 5% workers account for ~27.6% of claims).  
   - Demand surge periods (weekends, off-hour shifts).  
3. **Decision Criteria**  
   - Incremental cost per incentive vs. incremental fill rate improvement.  
   - Impact on specific segments of workers (e.g., new vs. veteran).  
   - Desired retention improvement (e.g., reduce churn by 2%).  
4. **Tradeoff Management**  
   - Incentives can boost supply but also raise overall cost.  
   - Overuse of incentives may reduce effectiveness if workers learn to wait for better deals.  
   - Need to differentiate incentives (e.g., new vs. returning workers) to avoid over-subsidizing.  
5. **Implementation Guide**  
   - Implement tiered incentives: new worker sign-up bonus, loyalty bonus, shift completion bonus for hard-to-fill shifts.  
   - Track incentive ROI via fill-time reduction and net churn changes.  
   - Segment test different incentive offers in different locations or shift types.  

### 1.4 Segment-Specific Pricing
1. **Decision Objective**  
   - Differentiate pricing strategies for distinct market segments (e.g., high-volume workplaces vs. smaller clinics).  
2. **Key Inputs**  
   - Workplace concentration metrics (top 5% workplaces post ~11.87% of shifts).  
   - Regional wage benchmarks.  
   - Shift types or specialties with distinct wage expectations.  
3. **Decision Criteria**  
   - Profitability benchmarks per segment (margins vs. volume).  
   - Relative fill-rate targets per segment.  
   - Worker supply elasticity (some specialties or regions might require higher pay to attract supply).  
4. **Tradeoff Management**  
   - Volume discounts for large workplaces encourage retention, but reduce per-shift margin.  
   - Premium rates for specialized shifts can improve fill rate but alienate cost-sensitive clients.  
   - Must balance overall marketplace viability with segment-based service level agreements.  
5. **Implementation Guide**  
   - Establish baseline prices for each segment, then apply dynamic adjustments for off-peak or urgent shifts.  
   - Conduct quarterly reviews to adjust segment pricing based on fill performance and workplace feedback.  
   - Offer tiered subscription/plans for workplaces to manage cost predictability.
