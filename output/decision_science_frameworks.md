## 1. Pricing Decisions

### 1A. Base Rate Determination

**1. Decision Objective**  
Set a baseline price that reflects fair market rates, ensures competitive worker earnings, and meets workplace budgets.

**2. Key Inputs**  
- Historical fill rates and time-to-fill by job category  
- Regional average wage or fee benchmarks  
- Worker satisfaction metrics (e.g., average shift acceptance rates)  
- Retention data (e.g., 30-day retention rates at different pay bands)

**3. Decision Criteria**  
- Sufficient to attract an adequate supply of qualified workers (acceptance rate threshold)  
- Aligned with industry benchmarks (within ±5–10% of regional averages)  
- Positive margin after factoring in platform fees/commissions  
- Ability to maintain or improve retention above 87–88%  

**4. Tradeoff Management**  
- Higher base rate → Improves fill speed and worker satisfaction but may reduce workplace demand if too expensive.  
- Lower base rate → Increases workplace satisfaction and shift volume but may result in lower fill rates or worker churn.

**5. Implementation Guide**  
- Conduct quarterly market rate studies.  
- Adjust base rates in small increments (e.g., 3–5%) to test elasticity.  
- Monitor fill rates and retention for 2–4 weeks post-adjustment.  
- Standardize a 30-day review cycle to confirm alignment with broader market shifts.

---

### 1B. Dynamic Pricing Adjustments

**1. Decision Objective**  
Real-time or near-time price modifications to optimize fill rates, especially for short-lead-time or high-demand shifts.

**2. Key Inputs**  
- Lead time (time between shift posting and start)  
- Historical fill rates by hour/day/occupational title  
- Worker supply elasticity (how price changes impact acceptance)  
- Urgent fill patterns (e.g., last-minute surges in demand)

**3. Decision Criteria**  
- Price sensitivity threshold: Adjust only if fill likelihood < X% or if being unfilled causes high penalty.  
- Increment magnitude: Typically ±5–10% from base.  
- Time windows: More aggressive adjustments within 0–24 hours of shift start.

**4. Tradeoff Management**  
- Large, frequent price swings risk confusion and dissatisfaction from workplaces or workers.  
- Overly conservative changes may fail to address urgent fill needs.  
- Must ensure data signals (e.g., “last-minute price changes”) are legitimate and not system artifacts.

**5. Implementation Guide**  
- Implement a rules-based or machine learning system to trigger price surges when fill probability is below a defined threshold.  
- Use A/B testing to measure acceptance-increase vs. cost to workplaces.  
- Create alerts for suspicious or repeated price overrides to ensure data quality.

---

### 1C. Incentive Structure Decisions

**1. Decision Objective**  
Design bonus or premium pay to encourage worker actions that benefit marketplace efficiency (e.g., picking up undesirable shifts, short-notice shifts).

**2. Key Inputs**  
- Historical acceptance data for difficult-to-fill shifts (nights, weekends, rural locations)  
- Worker retention and satisfaction surveys  
- Cost per incentive budget vs. incremental revenue from filled shifts

**3. Decision Criteria**  
- ROI threshold: Total incentive cost ≤ additional revenue/unfilled shift losses mitigated.  
- Desired behavioral outcome: e.g., increase fill rates for weekend shifts by 15%.  
- Market fairness: Maintain consistency so workers don’t feel favoritism or unpredictability.

**4. Tradeoff Management**  
- Too generous incentives → Could overspend with limited incremental benefit.  
- Unattractive incentives → Fails to change behavior, leaving certain shifts repeatedly unfilled.  
- Need to balance short-term fill rates with long-term trust in stable compensation structures.

**5. Implementation Guide**  
- Pilot incentive programs on a subset of shifts or locations.  
- Monitor fill rate changes, cost per shift, and worker feedback.  
- Scale successful incentives platform-wide, with periodic reevaluation of cost-effectiveness.

---

### 1D. Segment-Specific Pricing

**1. Decision Objective**  
Tailor pricing strategies for distinct segments (e.g., skill level, specialty type, or location) to maximize match rates and satisfaction.

**2. Key Inputs**  
- Segment-level supply/demand elasticity  
- Segment-level retention (e.g., high-value “Power Workers” vs. new workers)  
- Competitive landscape (regional wage rate differences)

**3. Decision Criteria**  
- Segment attractiveness: If certain skills or locations are in short supply, adjust price to ensure availability.  
- Workplace budget thresholds: Some specialties have higher budget caps.  
- Worker skill-level demand: Specialists vs. general roles may have different fill dynamics.

**4. Tradeoff Management**  
- Over-segmentation → Complexity in pricing model, risk of confusion.  
- Uniform approach → Missed opportunities to better serve specialized niches or high-demand skill sets.

**5. Implementation Guide**  
- Identify top 3–5 highest-demand or hardest-to-fill segments.  
- Establish separate baseline rates with dynamic adjustments specifically calibrated to each segment’s fill history.  
- Maintain transparency by communicating standard baseline differences to workplaces.
