# 1. Matching Process Assessment

### Current State of Marketplace Matching
- The marketplace heavily depends on a relatively small pool of active workers (the top 20% of workers account for 100% of all claimed shifts).  
- Demand (posted shifts) tends to be stable, while supply (active workers) fluctuates significantly based on timing, economic conditions, and perceived job quality.  
- Workplaces vary substantially in fill rates. A small fraction of workplaces (19 “problematic workplaces”) have persistently low fill rates, indicating a mismatch in scheduling, pay, or working conditions.  

### Key Matching Challenges and Opportunities
- Low overall fill rate (63.56%) demonstrates inefficiencies in directing workers to high-need shifts.  
- Potential duplication of offers to the same worker for the same shift inflates the data if not cleaned. This skews insights on dynamic pricing or shift popularity.  
- Workers with low claim rates lead to unfilled demand, while reliable “High-Volume Regulars” risk over-allocation and burnout.  
- Workplaces with low fill rates need targeted interventions (e.g., improved shift details, pay adjustments, or scheduling changes).  

### Strategic Matching Objectives
1. Increase fill rate by better aligning shift postings and worker preferences.  
2. Improve average claim rate while maintaining a high completion rate.  
3. Balance short-term fill needs with long-term marketplace health by preventing worker burnout and workplace dissatisfaction.  
4. Encourage sustained engagement among “Selective Pickers” and newer workers still developing on-platform habits.  

### Matching Optimization Levers Available
1. Information Asymmetry Reduction: Provide more transparent shift details, pay rates, workplace reputations, and worker profiles.  
2. Search and Discovery Enhancements: Streamline how workers find and filter shifts based on location, skills, and preferences.  
3. Preference Matching: Understand worker and workplace preferences (shift times, skill sets, pay, location) and optimize match suggestions.  
4. Friction Reduction: Simplify the process from shift posting to claim acceptance.  
5. Matching Algorithm Optimization: Personalize shift recommendations to each worker segment and each workplace scenario.  
6. Reputation and Trust Systems: Encourage reliable workplaces and trustworthy, consistent workers to remain engaged and build confidence on both sides.

# 2. Information Quality and Transparency

### Current Information Gaps and Asymmetries
- Shift details (exact responsibilities, equipment provided, potential hazards) are not always complete or standardized.  
- Workers may only see snapshot pay or incomplete workplace reputations, limiting their willingness to claim.  
- Workplaces do not always have full visibility into worker reliability or skillset beyond limited reviews.  

### Recommendations to Improve Information Quality
1. Standardized Shift Posting Format:  
   - Require workplaces to include essential details (role, responsibilities, pay, shift length, location, etc.).  
   - Create consistent data structures so that repeated updates to the same shift are recognized as “offer updates,” preventing skewed dynamic analyses.  

2. Enhanced Workplace Profiles:  
   - Provide historical fill rates, average worker ratings, and safety/compliance records.  
   - Encourage employers to add photos or additional context that help workers anticipate on-the-job conditions.  

3. Enriched Worker Profiles for Employers:  
   - Summarize worker reliability metrics (completion rate, average response time, skill endorsements).  
   - Provide anonymized composite ratings for privacy assurance but highlight relevant credentials (e.g., certifications for specialized roles).  

### Transparency Enhancements
- Upfront “Shift Score” for workers, factoring in pay, commute distance, workplace reliability, shift difficulty, etc.  
- Clear communication of pay breakdowns or shift fees (if applicable).  
- Worker feedback loops: Provide real-time data on how many shifts are available, location/commute-time suggestions, and current claim velocity.  

### Implementation Considerations
- Ensure data standardization efforts do not overburden workplaces or deter them from posting; automate data capture wherever possible.  
- Integrate mandatory data fields in the shift posting interface and offer an API for workplace data ingestion.

# 3. Search and Discovery Optimization

### Current Search and Discovery Limitations
- Workers may face difficulty finding the right shifts due to an unrefined search interface or limited ability to personalize results.  
- “Selective Pickers” might not see shifts that closely match their specialty or schedule if the algorithm relies heavily on broad matching.  
- As the number of posted shifts grows, it may be challenging for new or less active workers to immediately find appealing opportunities.  

### Recommendations to Improve Findability
1. Faceted Search and Filters:  
   - Provide robust filters (shift time, location radius, specialty, pay range, facility type).  
   - Enable sorting by pay, workplace reputation, shift length, or start time.  
2. Location-Based Optimization:  
   - Incorporate commute-time estimates or address-based proximity to highlight hyper-local shifts.  
3. Intelligent Ranking and Highlighting:  
   - Prioritize listing shifts that need urgent fill, have historically low fill rates, or match the worker’s previous engagements.  
4. Mobile-First Alerts and Recommendations:  
   - Send push notifications for shifts that match user preferences (e.g., same facility type, location radius, or pay thresholds).  

### Personalization and Relevance Strategies
- Use collaborative filtering, referencing the claiming patterns of similar workers, to surface relevant shifts.  
- Introduce dynamic preference models that learn from each worker’s acceptance, rejection, or ignoring of shift offers over time.  

### Implementation Approach
- Roll out faceted filtering and new ranking methods incrementally, testing success via search-to-claim conversions.  
- Track search usage patterns (most-commonly used filters, searched roles, etc.) to refine the user interface.

# 4. Preference Matching Enhancements

### Better Understanding of Participant Preferences
- Gather explicit worker preferences on shift times, facility types, and pay thresholds during onboarding or via periodic surveys.  
- Encourage workplaces to detail their preferences for worker qualifications or minimum rating to reduce mismatches.  

### Using Preferences in Matching
1. Preference-Driven Recommendations:  
   - Leverage explicit (worker-chosen filters) and implicit (past claiming behavior) signals to rank shift recommendations.  
2. Schedule Compatibility:  
   - Match shifts to workers’ available calendars or declared availability to reduce no-shows.  
3. Pay Sensitivity Adjustments:  
   - If data suggests certain worker segments respond to pay-level differences, surfaces that in real-time (e.g., “X% pay bump needed for overnight shifts”).  

### Preference Learning and Adaptation
- Continually refine matching models as new data on shift acceptance/rejection flows in.  
- Incorporate feedback loops where workers can “favorite” or “block” certain workplaces or shift types.  

### Implementation Considerations
- Start with simple preference collection and expand to advanced preference predictions over time.  
- Respect privacy: Keep user preferences anonymous when aggregated for marketplace analytics

# 5. Matching Algorithm Recommendations

### Current Algorithm Limitations
- Possible over-reliance on recency or availability signals, ignoring deeper preference insights.  
- May not adequately differentiate urgent fill needs from standard postings.  
- Lacks modular ability to filter out repeated “offer updates” for the same shift, leading to skewed dynamic analytics.  

### Specific Algorithm Improvement Recommendations
1. Weighted Matching Approach:  
   - Blend a base score (location match, role match, pay rate) with preference alignment (time of day, workplace rating) and urgency factors (deadline to filling shift).  
2. Segment-Specific Strategies:  
   - “High-Volume Regulars”: Offer premium shift notifications or loyalty perks to ensure they continue claiming.  
   - “Selective Pickers”: Highlight high-trust workplaces and premium shifts.  
   - New or Return Workers: Provide suggestions that minimize friction and build their confidence (e.g., well-rated, close-by workplaces).  
3. Dynamic Pay and Shift Ordering:  
   - Adjust shift visibility or pay suggestions (surge pricing) when data shows supply shortfalls at specific times.  

### Balancing Different Matching Objectives
- Ensure short-term fill rates for high-urgency roles while maintaining good worker pay satisfaction to avoid longer-term turnover.  
- Protect worker experience by capping shift offers if they are at risk of overextending themselves.  

### Implementation and Testing Approach
- Use a two-phase pilot:  
   1. Pilot new matching rules with a subset of workplaces and worker segments.  
   2. Measure fill rate changes, cancellation rates, and time-to-fill improvements.  
- Monitor potential biases in the algorithm (e.g., overshadowing new workplaces, over-prioritizing top workers).

# 6. Reputation and Trust Systems

### Current Trust Mechanism Limitations
- Basic rating or review systems may not effectively differentiate high-performing workplaces or workers.  
- “Problematic workplaces” with historically low fill rates may not have clear incentives to increase trust.  

### Reputation System Recommendations
1. Employer Reputation Score:  
   - Incorporate fill rates, cancellation rates, worker feedback, and compliance track records to generate a robust employer score.  
   - Display top-tier or “Preferred” badges for workplaces that maintain above 80% fill rate and strong worker reviews.  
2. Worker Trust Scores:  
   - Combine completion rates, past performance, reliability signals (quick acceptance time).  
   - Create “Elite Worker” status for those consistently meeting performance criteria (e.g., 95% completion, minimal cancellations, historically high rating).  

### Quality Signaling Improvements
- Prominent badges or icons to differentiate “Preferred Workplaces” and “Elite Workers.”  
- Make the review process more structured: short, consistent feedback categories (work environment, fairness of pay, reliability).  

### Implementation Considerations
- Balance completeness of reviews with survey fatigue. Offer short, user-friendly feedback prompts.  
- Use the reputation system as a gating mechanism for more advanced features (e.g., direct matching or shift auto-reservation for top-tier workers/workplaces).

# 7. Experimentation and Optimization Plan

### Key Hypotheses to Test
1. Providing richer shift details (and a “Shift Score”) will increase acceptance rates among both “High-Volume Regulars” and “Selective Pickers.”  
2. Personalized shift recommendations based on preference data will reduce time to fill and increase overall fill rates.  
3. Surge or dynamic pay adjustments for overnight or “problematic workplace” shifts will improve fill rates without significantly increasing cancellations.  
4. A reputation and badge system will encourage better employer behavior (higher pay, more detailed shift postings) and increase worker trust.  

### A/B Testing Approach
- Randomly assign subsets of workers/workplaces to new features (e.g., newly improved search filters, dynamic pay promotions, richer shift details).  
- Compare fill rates, cancellation rates, and worker satisfaction scores between test and control groups.  
- Collect feedback directly post-shift to gauge changes in participants’ experiences.  

### Success Metrics
- Fill Rate Improvement: Increase from 63.56% to a target (e.g., 70%+).  
- Claim Rate Improvement: Raise from 4.91% to a meaningful increment.  
- Reduced Time to Fill: Lower the average time to claim from posting to acceptance.  
- Satisfaction Scores: Track workplace and worker net promoter scores (NPS) or in-app survey ratings.  

### Implementation Timeline
1. Month 1–2: Data Cleanup & Standardization  
   - Implement shift data standardization, label repeated “offer updates,” and unify data schemas.  
2. Month 3–4: Pilot Information, Search, and Preference Enhancements  
   - Launch improved shift postings, advanced search, preference-based recommendations.  
3. Month 5–6: Roll Out Matching Algorithm and Reputation System Upgrade  
   - Test dynamic matching logic, record fill rate changes, introduce badges for top-tier users.  
4. Ongoing: Iterate and Refine  
   - Monitor outcomes, refine the approach based on real-time feedback and metrics.
