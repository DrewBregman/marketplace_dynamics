## 1. Matching Process Assessment

### Current State of Marketplace Matching
- The marketplace suffers from heavily skewed participation on both sides:
  – Workers: Top 20% account for 100% of all claimed shifts, with 87% of workers never claiming any shift.  
  – Workplaces: Top 20% of workplaces account for 71.35% of all posted shifts.  
- Overall fill rate stands at 63.56%, indicating that more than one-third of posted shifts do not get filled.  
- Claim rates vary significantly by day and time, with weekends (notably Saturday at 3.74% claim rate) and off-peak hours particularly problematic.  
- A small subset of problematic workplaces (19 identified) consistently exhibit low fill rates.

### Key Matching Challenges and Opportunities
- Over-Reliance on “High-Volume Regulars”: Risk of burnout and capacity limits if demand spikes.  
- Under-Engagement of the Broader Worker Base: 87% of workers have never claimed, suggesting untapped supply.  
- Inconsistent Workplace Posting Behaviors: Some workplaces post shifts with insufficient lead time or insufficient pay.  
- Information Gaps: Workers may lack real-time visibility into open shifts and logistical details.  
- Trust Deficits: Workplaces with low fill rates may appear less attractive to potential workers.  
- Time/Day Specific Imbalances: Certain hours and days suffer persistent supply-demand mismatches.

### Strategic Matching Objectives
- Increase Overall Fill Rate Above 75%: By engaging underutilized workers and optimizing shift discovery.  
- Diversify Worker Supply: Encourage more than the top 20% to claim.  
- Improve Timely Posting Quality: Ensure workplaces provide accurate, early, and competitive postings.  
- Enhance Time-Specific Matching: Target known bottlenecks (e.g., weekends, midday).  
- Sustain Long-Term Satisfaction: Balance short-term fill rates with ensuring both workers and workplaces remain engaged and trust the marketplace.

### Matching Optimization Levers Available
1. Information Asymmetry Reduction: Transparent shift details, clearer pay structures.  
2. Search and Discovery Enhancement: Smarter filters, personalized recommendations.  
3. Preference Matching: Incorporating more nuanced preferences (e.g., location, shift length, pay).  
4. Friction Reduction: Easier workflows for claiming or posting shifts.  
5. Matching Algorithm Optimization: Improving how shifts are ranked and recommended.  
6. Reputation and Trust Systems: Providing more robust signals of reliability and quality.

## 2. Information Quality and Transparency

### Current Information Gaps and Asymmetries
- Workers often see only limited information on each shift (e.g., basic pay rate, location), making it difficult to assess total compensation (including travel time, shift length, potential bonuses).  
- Workplaces get limited visibility into worker reliability indicators beyond basic profile completion and completion rates.

### Recommendations to Improve Information Quality
1. Enhanced Shift Details:  
   - Display total estimated earnings (shift pay + potential bonuses), shift length, and commute considerations.  
   - Show real-time updates for shifts that are close to being filled or have high demand.  
2. Richer Workplace Profiles:  
   - Include fill rates and historical shift success rates.  
   - Show standardized feedback metrics from past workers.  
3. More Granular Worker Profiles:  
   - Highlight relevant experience and prior shift feedback.  
   - Provide indicators of reliability (e.g., cancellation rate, timeliness).

### Transparency Enhancements
- Introduce a “Trust Score” or “Reliability Score” visible to both parties, factoring in fill rates, completion rates, cancellations, and feedback.  
- Provide open commentary sections or star ratings from a worker’s perspective on workplace conditions.

### Implementation Considerations
- Ensure compliance with privacy regulations—only share aggregate or anonymized feedback where necessary.  
- Incrementally release transparent metrics to avoid overwhelming participants (e.g., pilot with a limited group of workplaces).

## 3. Search and Discovery Optimization

### Current Search and Discovery Limitations
- Workers may have to sift through numerous postings without clear sorting or filtering options that match their preferences (e.g., location, shift type, pay range).  
- Workplaces might struggle to make postings discoverable if they don’t align with typical worker preferences or if they fail to stand out among numerous postings.

### Recommendations to Improve Findability
1. Filter & Sorting Enhancement:  
   - Add dynamic filters by shift time of day, location radius, pay range, or workplace reputation.  
   - Implement sorting by personalized relevance (e.g., “Recommended”, highest pay, shortest commute).  
2. “Saved Search” and Email/SMS Alerts:  
   - Let workers save specific search criteria (e.g., “Pediatric roles within 10 miles”).  
   - Send instant notifications when relevant shifts are posted.  
3. Geographic & Time-Based Targeting:  
   - Deprioritize postings outside a worker’s feasible commute range or typical time availability.  
   - Provide workplaces with guidance (e.g., “peak posting time is X hour to attract more claims”).

### Personalization and Relevance Strategies
- Use machine learning models trained on past worker behavior (claimed vs. viewed, completed vs. canceled) to personalize shift recommendations.  
- Offer workplaces “recommended posting times” based on shift fill success analytics.

### Implementation Approach
- Start with enhanced sorting/filtering in a beta environment and measure changes in claim rates and fill times.  
- Gradually roll out personalized alerts and measure engagement (alert open rate, claim conversions).

## 4. Preference Matching Enhancements

### How to Better Understand Participant Preferences
- Continuously collect explicit preferences via worker-facing settings (e.g., maximum travel distance, preferred shift length, pay minimum).  
- Use implicit signals from platform activity (e.g., shifts viewed, time spent, shifts claimed/favorite) to refine preference models.

### How to Use Preferences in Matching
- Prioritize shifts in worker feeds that align with indicated preferences, while also mixing in a small subset of exploratory options to discover new interests.  
- For workplaces, highlight worker segments that are likely to respond to shift requirements (e.g., certain licenses, availability patterns).

### Preference Learning and Adaptation
- Leverage collaborative filtering or similarity clustering to recommend shifts that similar workers have found appealing.  
- Update models weekly or monthly to incorporate the latest preference data as worker interests or location constraints change.

### Implementation Considerations
- Manage complexity so that workers are not overwhelmed by preference configuration; use defaults and optional advanced settings.  
- Provide an opt-out for workers who prefer a simpler feed, letting them rely on general search and discovery.

## 5. Matching Algorithm Recommendations

### Current Algorithm Limitations
- Likely relies on basic listing or chronological ordering, missing opportunities to optimize fill rates.  
- Does not incorporate real-time data on supply-demand imbalances or participant preferences.

### Specific Algorithm Improvement Recommendations
1. Real-Time Supply-Demand Weighting:  
   - Boost shifts that are undersubscribed or nearing start time to prioritize quick fill.  
2. Preference-Based Ranking:  
   - Integrate worker preference vectors (location, shift type, pay) to reorder postings.  
3. Predictive Matching:  
   - Use historical data to predict which workers are most likely to accept a given shift and surface targeted notifications.  
4. Tiered Ranking:  
   - Tier 1: Highly matched (meets multiple preference criteria), Tier 2: Moderately matched, Tier 3: Exploratory.

### Balancing Different Matching Objectives
- Short-Term Fills vs. Long-Term Engagement: Introduce feedback loops to prevent worker fatigue (e.g., limit push notifications if a worker declines multiple shifts).  
- Fairness vs. Efficiency: Ensure smaller or newer workplaces get visibility if they meet baseline pay and reliability standards.

### Implementation and Testing Approach
- Start with a pilot implementing preference-based ranking in a targeted region or shift category.  
- Measure fill rate changes, worker acceptance rates, and time-to-claim.  
- Iterate the ranking model with an A/B test comparing the new approach to the old chronological listing.

## 6. Reputation and Trust Systems

### Current Trust Mechanism Limitations
- Minimal transparency about workplace reliability, fill history, or feedback from workers.  
- Worker reliability measures (e.g., completion rate, timeliness) may not be clearly visible or standardized for workplaces.

### Reputation System Recommendations
1. Introduce Workplace “Shift Success Score”:  
   - Weighted by fill rate, timely payment, worker feedback.  
2. Enhance Worker Reliability Indicators:  
   - Include on-time arrival rate, cancellation severity (e.g., late cancellations vs. early no-shows).  
3. Publicly Display Summaries:  
   - Show average ratings or badges for “Consistent Filler” (workplace) or “Reliable Worker” (worker).  

### Quality Signaling Improvements
- Tie platform recognition (e.g., “Trusted Employer” badge) to metrics like ≥80% fill rates, minimal last-minute cancellations, fair pay rates.  
- Provide an option for workers to write short feedback about workplace conditions, visible after a threshold for anonymity.

### Implementation Considerations
- Pilot the “Shift Success Score” with consenting workplaces, then expand.  
- Carefully moderate feedback to prevent abuse (e.g., harassment or spam).  
- Provide dispute resolution for contested feedback or rating errors.

## 7. Experimentation and Optimization Plan

### Key Hypotheses to Test
1. Displaying richer shift information (estimated total pay, commute distance) will increase claim rates.  
2. Personalized shift recommendations lead to a faster fill time and higher overall fill rates.  
3. Reputation scores for workplaces will encourage better posting practices (competitive pay, advance posting).  
4. Introducing worker reliability badges increases the selection rate for newly participating workers.

### A/B Testing Approach
- Split the user base into control (current experience) and variant (enhanced features).  
- Monitor difference in fill rates, claim rates, time-to-fill, and user satisfaction.  
- Use segmented analysis (e.g., High-Volume Regulars vs. new workers) to ensure features work across different cohorts.

### Success Metrics
- Fill Rate Increase (target >75% overall).  
- Claim Rate Increase (target 20% improvement over baseline).  
- Worker Engagement (daily active claimers, number of newly active claimers).  
- Workplaces with ≥80% fill rate growth.  
- Reduction in last-minute cancellations.

### Implementation Timeline
1. Month 1–2: Pilot improved shift information, basic filtering enhancements.  
2. Month 3–4: Deploy personalized recommendations, preference capture.  
3. Month 5–6: Launch reputation and trust features; measure changes in posting/reliability behaviors.  
4. Month 7+: Optimize the algorithm, finalize rollout across all regions.
