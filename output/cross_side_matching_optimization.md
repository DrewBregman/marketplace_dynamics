## 1. Matching Process Assessment

### Current State of Marketplace Matching
- High concentration of shift claims among a small subset of “Core Committed” workers (top 20% of workers make 100% of claims).  
- Overall fill rate is moderate (63.56%), but some workplaces fall significantly below average.  
- Certain workplaces have consistently low fill rates (19 problematic workplaces), while others show high fill rates but drive the majority of posted shifts (top 20% of workplaces account for 71.35% of shifts).  
- Data integrity issues (e.g., conflicting pay rates for the same shift, short lead-time postings with multiple listings) can mask true last-minute changes and demand.

### Key Matching Challenges and Opportunities
- Short lead-time shifts often experience demand surges, yet cancellations and mislabeling can disrupt reliable matching.  
- Over-reliance on “Core Committed” workers risks burnout and can limit broader worker engagement.  
- Workplaces with low fill rates may be lacking key information or trust; or may post shifts under conditions unfavorable to worker preferences (e.g., poorly timed postings, unclear role details).  
- Large pool of workers (87% never claiming a shift) remains underutilized.  

### Strategic Matching Objectives
1. Increase marketplace fill rates across all workplace segments.  
2. Diversify the active worker base to reduce overdependence on “Core Committed” workers.  
3. Improve short-lead time fills without creating price or scheduling confusion.  
4. Enhance data consistency to better capture real-time trends and reduce artificial noise around pay rates and shift postings.

### Matching Optimization Levers Available
- Data consistency enhancements (shift-level aggregation, validated price updates).  
- Improved transparency of venue, role, pay, and scheduling details.  
- Smart shift recommendations to workers based on real-time availability, pay alignment, and preferences.  
- Reputation systems that highlight highly rated workplaces and workers.  
- Targeted incentives to balance short-term fill goals with long-term marketplace health.

## 2. Information Quality and Transparency

### Current Information Gaps and Asymmetries
- Incomplete or fragmented shift data (e.g., multiple postings for the same shift, discrepancies in pay).  
- Workplaces lack visibility into whether their pay rates or shift specifics are competitive.  
- Workers may not have sufficient details on workplace conditions, location specifics, or shift complexity prior to claiming.  
- Unclear feedback loops on cancellations and no-shows (e.g., a cancellation reason is not always logged or visible).

### Recommendations to Improve Information Quality
1. Enforce Shift Data Consistency:
   - Implement unique shift IDs and require all updates to reference the same shift listing.  
   - Consolidate pay updates into a single version history so workers see transparent pay adjustments.  
2. Standardized Workplace Profiles:
   - Require workplaces to provide detailed facility type information (skill requirements, environment, shift pattern) for every posting.  
   - Integrate workplace-level historical fill rates, worker reviews, and average pay levels.  
3. Worker Profile Enhancements:
   - Encourage workers to list their skill sets, certifications, and location preferences.  
   - Provide better tracking and display of their past shift completion and ratings.

### Transparency Enhancements
- Real-Time Pay Benchmarks: Show workplaces how their proposed pay ranks against the local market.  
- Shift Complexity Indicators: Surface additional skill or environment details to workers to reduce surprise factors.  
- Cancellation and No-Show Reason Codes: Make aggregated data available to workplaces so they can adjust shift parameters accordingly.

### Implementation Considerations
- Develop or update data schemas for shift-level records and workplace profiles.  
- Build user-friendly interfaces for workplaces to enter data consistently, and for workers to see relevant shift descriptors.  
- Train customer support teams to flag and correct data errors quickly.

## 3. Search and Discovery Optimization

### Current Search and Discovery Limitations
- Shifts may be buried among many listings, especially for popular geographies or short-lead times.  
- Algorithmic recommendations may not account for nuanced worker preferences (e.g., shift type, skill alignment, commute preferences, workplace reputation).  
- Low-engagement workers do not easily discover feasible or attractive shifts that match their schedules.

### Recommendations to Improve Findability
1. Contextual Shift Ranking:  
   - Boost shifts with higher worker-market fit (matching skill sets, preferred location, competitive pay).  
   - Down-rank incomplete listings or those with repeated cancellations.  
2. Segmented Worker Portals:  
   - For “Core Committed” workers, highlight top-paying or short-lead-time shifts they are well-qualified for.  
   - For new/infrequent workers, surface simpler or nearby shifts to encourage first-time claims.  
3. Smart Filters:  
   - Add filters for skill level, commute distance, facility type, shift length, and pay range.  
   - Provide recommended filtering defaults for workers so they can quickly narrow down shifts.

### Personalization and Relevance Strategies
- Implement collaborative filtering: show “similar shifts to ones you’ve claimed” or “workplaces similar to where you’ve worked.”  
- Use preference data (e.g., shift times, roles) to warn workplaces if their posting is out of alignment with typical worker interest.  
- Integrate reviews and ratings into shift listings to highlight high-trust opportunities.

### Implementation Approach
- Incrementally roll out new filters in the worker app, measure usage and conversion.  
- Use A/B tests to evaluate whether personalized shift recommendations increase claim rates, particularly among low-engagement worker segments.

## 4. Preference Matching Enhancements

### How to Better Understand Participant Preferences
- Collect explicit worker preferences (shift durations, facility types, commute radius) on registration or periodically via surveys.  
- Track implicit preferences through shift browsing history, partial claim steps, and shifts actually worked vs. declined.

### How to Use Preferences in Matching
- Dynamically prioritize shifts that align with workers’ top preferences in the feed.  
- Provide workplaces with guidance on how to structure roles, shift times, or pay rates that match worker patterns.  
- Allow workers to “follow” certain workplaces or facility types, receiving notifications for relevant postings.

### Preference Learning and Adaptation
- Leverage machine learning to detect changing preferences (e.g., willingness to accept higher-paying but longer commute shifts).  
- Reassess the quality of matches post-completion (e.g., worker rating after shift) to refine future recommendations.

### Implementation Considerations
- Start with a simplified rules-based approach to incorporate explicit preferences.  
- Phase in machine learning models as data volume grows.  
- Use iterative feedback loops—request worker feedback on a recommended shift to refine preference models.

## 5. Matching Algorithm Recommendations

### Current Algorithm Limitations
- Overly simplistic ranking of shifts by posting time or pay rate, ignoring deeper preference matching and trust signals.  
- Lack of dynamic adjustments for short-lead vs. long-lead shifts.  
- Limited feedback loops feeding real-time supply-demand signals into recommendations (e.g., sudden shortfall or high demand).

### Specific Algorithm Improvement Recommendations
1. Multi-Factor Scoring Model:
   - Incorporate pay competitiveness, shift distance, worker skill alignment, shift lead time, workplace reputation, and worker preferences into a scoring formula.  
2. Dynamic Prioritization:
   - For short-lead or high-priority shifts, temporarily boost visibility to workers who have flexible schedules.  
   - For “Core Committed” workers, rotate high-urgency shifts to avoid overloading them and risking burnout.  
3. Real-Time Demand Feedback:
   - If a shift remains unclaimed after a certain time, algorithmically suggest minor pay adjustments or highlight it to a broader worker pool.

### Balancing Different Matching Objectives
- Aim for overall fill rate improvement while preventing fatigue among top workers.  
- Incorporate a “satisfaction weight,” using feedback from both workers and workplaces.  
- Ensure a comfortable margin of short-term fill success without jeopardizing long-term worker engagement.

### Implementation and Testing Approach
- Develop a pilot environment testing a new multi-factor ranking engine.  
- Run parallel A/B tests: one group uses the current system, the other uses the new multi-factor approach.  
- Compare fill rates, worker satisfaction, and shift completion outcomes.

## 6. Reputation and Trust Systems

### Current Trust Mechanism Limitations
- Limited visibility into workplace histories for workers: fill rates, cancellation rates, environment/facility issues.  
- Inadequate feedback loop for workplaces to see detailed worker reliability beyond a basic completion rate.  
- Potential bias or lack of nuance in rating systems (workers or workplaces might have a single “score,” lacking detail).

### Reputation System Recommendations
1. Detailed Rating Dimensions:
   - Rate workplaces on clarity of instructions, environment quality, timeliness of payment, etc.  
   - Rate workers on punctuality, skill proficiency, professionalism.  
2. Verified Badges and Milestones:
   - “Top Worker” badges for consistently high completion rates, low cancellations, and strong performance reviews.  
   - “Reliable Workplace” status for those with fill rates >80% and minimal late cancellations.  
3. Feedback Transparency:
   - Summarize rating trends in workplace or worker profiles to encourage improvements.  
   - Integrate complaints or issue resolution data to highlight serious or repeated issues.

### Quality Signaling Improvements
- Promote top-rated workplaces in search results, encouraging them to maintain trust and favorable conditions.  
- Highlight worker achievements (e.g., completed 100 shifts) to workplaces to boost worker desirability.

### Implementation Considerations
- Gradual rollout of multi-dimensional ratings to avoid confusion and rating fatigue.  
- Provide guidelines to ensure fair and constructive ratings and reduce fraudulent or malicious feedback.

## 7. Experimentation and Optimization Plan

### Key Hypotheses to Test
1. Enhanced transparency (unique shift IDs, better pay update tracking) will reduce worker confusion and increase fill rates.  
2. Personalized shift recommendations (based on skill, location, schedule preferences) will improve first-claim rates among inactive or new workers.  
3. A multi-factor ranking algorithm will balance short-term fill success with a healthier distribution of work among the broader worker base.  
4. A richer reputation system will motivate workplaces to improve shift details and pay, while encouraging workers to maintain high completion standards.

### A/B Testing Approach
- Select a representative subset of workers and workplaces for each test variant.  
- Measure key metrics such as claim rate, fill rate, cancellation rate, and shift completion satisfaction.  
- Track changes in the distribution of claims—especially whether more workers become active.

### Success Metrics
- Higher overall fill rate (target increase from 63.56% to >70%).  
- Reduced reliance on “Core Committed” group (monitor share of claims from top 20% of workers).  
- Improved short-lead-time fill rates (e.g., measure fill rate for shifts posted <24 hours in advance).  
- Increased net promoter score (NPS) or satisfaction among both workers and workplaces.

### Implementation Timeline
1. Month 1–2:  
   - Data quality fixes (unique shift IDs, pay update transparency).  
   - Launch updated shift and workplace profile interfaces.  
2. Month 3–4:  
   - Roll out new search filters, personalized recommendations, and expand explicit preference collection.  
   - Begin A/B tests on multi-factor ranking algorithm.  
3. Month 5–6:  
   - Introduce multi-dimensional ratings, build trust badges, and track changes in fill behavior.  
   - Evaluate test results, refine algorithms, and plan for broader release.  
4. Ongoing:  
   - Continuous model optimization using real-time feedback loops to adapt to market shifts.
