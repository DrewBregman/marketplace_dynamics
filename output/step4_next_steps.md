## 1. Research Priorities

### Top 3–5 Knowledge Gaps Worth Addressing

1. **Offer Overshoot vs. True Supply-Demand Equilibrium**  
   - **Gap**: We do not yet fully understand how the practice of sending multiple offers per shift distorts measures of fill rates, worker churn, and price sensitivity.  
   - **Rationale**: Precisely quantifying this gap is critical to understanding whether we are truly oversupplying offers or whether certain shift types genuinely experience worker shortages.  
   - **Value of Research**: Clarifying how often, how quickly, and at what rate shifts are being over-posted will illuminate true supply-demand balances, enabling more accurate predictions.

2. **Burnout Thresholds for High-Volume Regulars**  
   - **Gap**: Current analyses point to potential worker burnout driving last-minute cancellations and churn, but we lack deeper psychological or workload-related benchmarks for “burnout.”  
   - **Rationale**: High-Volume Regulars are key to stable coverage. Understanding their capacity limits can inform scheduling, incentive structures, and retention strategies.  
   - **Value of Research**: Pinpointing the causes and early warning signs of burnout can help maintain consistent coverage and stave off churn that undermines fill rates.

3. **Rate Escalation Drivers and Feedback Loops**  
   - **Gap**: The interplay between late postings, selective acceptance, and rate creep needs further examination to confirm precise triggers for sudden pay hikes.  
   - **Rationale**: Identifying the specific time thresholds (e.g., 12 or 24-hour mark) and communication patterns that start driving pay upward can help prevent runaway compensation costs.  
   - **Value of Research**: With clear data, we can enact targeted measures to avoid perpetual rate inflation while still maintaining adequate fill rates.

4. **Growth and Retention of Occasional Workers**  
   - **Gap**: We see that many Occasional Workers can be “nurtured” into High-Volume participants, but we do not fully understand the conditions (e.g., facility matching, shift consistency) that cause this conversion.  
   - **Rationale**: Converting Occasional Workers into more reliable, repeat participants grows the marketplace’s capacity to handle surges.  
   - **Value of Research**: Detailed understanding of the conversion triggers can guide structured onboarding and retention strategies.

5. **Cancellation Clusters and Their Predictive Value**  
   - **Gap**: While we have identified certain time windows with high cancellation rates, we need to understand the root causes—are workers double-booking, underestimating travel time, or responding to better-paying offers elsewhere?  
   - **Rationale**: Facilitating greater reliability requires tackling last-minute cancellations at their source.  
   - **Value of Research**: Pinpointing what precipitates these cancellations will enable more precise interventions (time-based or user-based) to minimize churn.

## 2. Data Collection Plan

### Additional Data Points

1. **Offer-Level Response and Timing**  
   - **What to Collect**: Timestamped records indicating how many distinct workers actually received, viewed, and responded to each shift offer.  
   - **Why**: Will clarify whether shifts remain unfilled due to truly insufficient workers or because too many workers are “standing by” until rates rise.

2. **Worker Engagement Metrics**  
   - **What to Collect**: Detailed shift acceptance patterns, login times, application usage durations, and user-initiated cancellations.  
   - **Why**: Identifies early warning signs of worker overload or burnout (e.g., big spikes in acceptance volume followed by cancellations).

3. **Shift Lead Time Metrics**  
   - **What to Collect**: Time between posting and shift start, plus time of day and day of week the posting occurs.  
   - **Why**: Helps isolate patterns that cause more frequent rate escalations and clarify how lead time interacts with fill success.

4. **Feedback and Satisfaction Data**  
   - **What to Collect**: Worker surveys or facility-level satisfaction ratings, including reasons for cancellations and preferences for shift types.  
   - **Why**: Can reveal qualitative drivers behind churn and acceptance decisions, complementing the quantitative churn analyses.

### Methods for Collecting New Data

- **Platform Event Logging**: Enhance logging to capture detailed in-app user activity (view, accept, reject, cancel) with timestamps.  
- **Targeted Surveys**: Periodic micro-surveys for workers and facility managers to gather context for acceptance decisions, cancellations, and job satisfaction.  
- **Longitudinal Tracking**: Extend data retention windows to observe transitions from Occasional Worker to High-Volume status.

### How It Complements Existing Analysis

- **Offer Overshoot Context**: New logs of how many offers are actually opened/acted upon will clarify actual acceptance rate per shift.  
- **Burnout Indicators**: Engagement data over time, coupled with surveys, can link worker sentiment to churn.  
- **Rate Fluctuation Insights**: Detailed lead-time data will refine the “trigger points” for compensation changes.

## 3. Validation Approaches

### Methodologies to Validate Key Insights

1. **Segmentation Analysis Upgrade**  
   - **Approach**: Employ clustering methods (k-means, hierarchical) to see if worker segments derived from new data (offer responses, usage) match our existing categories (High-Volume, Selective, Occasional).  
   - **Objective**: Validate or refine the current segmentation and confirm if newly captured data supports or contradicts observed user behavior patterns.

2. **Time-Series Modeling of Rate Changes**  
   - **Approach**: Use ARIMA or SARIMAX models to track compensation rates over time, factoring in lead time, day of week, and shift characteristics.  
   - **Objective**: Determine if rate increases are correlated with certain late-posting intervals or emergent supply shortages, isolating cause-effect relationships where possible.

3. **Cohort Studies for Worker Burnout**  
   - **Approach**: Track cohorts of High-Volume Regulars across multiple months to see when (and why) acceptance rates drop or cancellations rise.  
   - **Objective**: Identify precise thresholds (number of consecutive shifts, maximum hours worked) that correlate with increased churn.

### Determining Causality vs. Correlation

- **Instrumental Variables or Quasi-Experiments**: Leverage natural experiments (e.g., facility closures, policy changes) as “shock” events to see how workers respond when external conditions shift suddenly.  
- **Propensity Score Matching**: Compare workers or facilities with similar profiles (e.g., shift type, pay rate) but different posting times/rate escalation policies to isolate the effect of timing or pay strategies.

## 4. Limited Experiments

(Note: This section constitutes no more than one-third of the response.)

1. **Controlled Rate Escalation Timing**  
   - **Hypothesis**: Limiting pay increases to a predefined schedule (e.g., incremental upticks every 4 hours a shift remains unfilled) will reduce last-minute volatility without lowering overall fill rates.  
   - **Experiment Design**:  
     - Experimental Group: Facility postings follow a structured escalation schedule.  
     - Control Group: Facility postings operate with existing ad hoc escalation.  
     - Measurement: Compare fill times, final rates, and cancellation rates between groups over several weeks.  
   - **Expected Outcomes**:  
     - If structured increments tame excessive rate creep, the Experimental Group should see a smaller average pay increase per shift and stable fill times.

2. **Targeted Onboarding Pathways for Occasional Workers**  
   - **Hypothesis**: Tailored messaging and shift recommendations for new or Occasional Workers can accelerate their transition to Semi-Regular status.  
   - **Experiment Design**:  
     - Experimental Group: Receive customized notifications highlighting specific facilities, consistent shift types, and progressive incentives.  
     - Control Group: Receive generic marketplace updates with no personalized suggestions.  
   - **Measurement**: Track the conversion rate to High-Volume or repeated shift acceptance over two months.  
   - **Expected Outcomes**:  
     - If personalized onboarding successfully boosts engagement, the Experimental Group should display a higher ratio of repeated shift acceptance.

3. **Cancellation Preemption Alerts**  
   - **Hypothesis**: Sending proactive notifications to workers at known high-risk cancellation windows (e.g., 24–48 hours before shift) will reduce final cancellations.  
   - **Experiment Design**:  
     - Experimental Group: Automatic reminder texts or app alerts prompting workers to confirm or withdraw well in advance.  
     - Control Group: Standard approach with no mid-window reminders.  
   - **Measurement**: Compare cancellation rates, especially in the final 24 hours, between the two groups.  
   - **Expected Outcomes**:  
     - Fewer last-minute cancellations in the Experimental Group if timely reminders capture potential scheduling conflicts sooner.

## 5. Counter-Hypothesis Testing

### Alternative Explanations

1. **Facility-Specific Patterns vs. Worker Segments**  
   - **Counter-Hypothesis**: Observed churn or burnout might be driven more by facility-level conditions (e.g., poor management, confusing shift instructions) than by worker volume or staffing segment.  
   - **Testing**: Cross-check how frequently the same issues occur across multiple facilities for the same worker segment to see if the pattern is truly worker-centered.

2. **External Market Forces**  
   - **Counter-Hypothesis**: Broader economic conditions (e.g., a competing local marketplace, general nursing shortages) drive the rate creep and worker selectivity, rather than platform mechanics.  
   - **Testing**: Compare fill rates and pay rates in regions with varying levels of competition or labor availability.

3. **Timing Artifacts**  
   - **Counter-Hypothesis**: Rate escalation observed at nights/weekends might simply reflect typical labor laws, overtime rules, or personal worker scheduling preferences rather than a self-perpetuating loop.  
   - **Testing**: Control for known factors (overtime pay, holiday rates) to isolate increments in rates due to supply–demand feedback loops from mandated wage differentials.

### Methods to Rule Out or Confirm

- **Multi-Level Modeling**: Incorporate facility-level and regional-level random effects to see if certain phenomena (burnout, churn) remain significant within different contexts.  
- **Pre–Post Analysis**: Implement small policy or interface changes to see if hypothesized outcomes shift accordingly, confirming or refuting the cause-and-effect relationship.

### Critical Assumptions Requiring Scrutiny

- **Assumption of Worker Homogeneity in Burnout Thresholds**: Different individuals may have vastly different capacity for back-to-back shifts.  
- **Assumption That Rate Increases Are the Primary Attractor**: Workers might also prioritize location fit, shift length, or facility familiarity equally with pay.  
- **Assumption That Selective Pickers Always Wait for the Highest Rate**: Some may have personal scheduling constraints that only align with certain times, regardless of rate.
