# 1. Research Priorities

### A. Refined Worker Segmentation and Labeling
- **Knowledge Gap:** The current “Power Worker” label obscures nuances among actual top performers and confounds analysis of supply coverage.  
- **Rationale:** Pinpointing true high-performers is critical for targeted retention efforts and understanding the real capacity of the marketplace.  
- **Value of Further Research:** A refined segmentation approach would improve forecasting accuracy and reveal where intervention is needed to prevent burnout or sudden capacity drops.

### B. Impact of Facility-Worker Relationships on Fill Rates
- **Knowledge Gap:** Variations in fill rates persist despite similar pay schedules, suggesting unmeasured “relationship” variables (e.g., familiarity, commute distance).  
- **Rationale:** These untracked factors seem more predictive than pay alone in some regions, indicating a major driver of shift selection.  
- **Value of Further Research:** Better quantification of relationship-related factors could lead to more precise local strategies rather than uniform, nationwide solutions.

### C. Core Contributor Behavior and Burnout Risk
- **Knowledge Gap:** Over-reliance on a small group of “Core Committed” workers may not be fully visible if those workers appear under an inflated “Power Worker” label.  
- **Rationale:** If burnout or attrition among this group occurs, it can trigger widespread unfilled shifts and cause emergency pay hikes.  
- **Value of Further Research:** Identifying early warning signals of disengagement among core contributors would inform proactive retention measures.

### D. Fluid Segmentation Dynamics
- **Knowledge Gap:** Workers alternate among segments based on short-term incentives (e.g., “Core Committed” temporarily becoming “Opportunistic Fillers”).  
- **Rationale:** Rigid segmentation overlooks how workers adapt to shifting conditions, obscuring real-time market changes.  
- **Value of Further Research:** Capturing these shifts in near-real-time would refine forecasts and improve pay/shift posting strategies.

### E. Local vs. National Equilibrium Pressures
- **Knowledge Gap:** Uniform pay or strategy guidelines may fail in undersupplied areas with unique local dynamics.  
- **Rationale:** Market mechanics differ regionally, creating “micro-markets” that defy one-size-fits-all approaches.  
- **Value of Further Research:** A deeper understanding of local labor markets ensures interventions are appropriately scaled and contextualized.

# 2. Data Collection Plan

### A. Additional Data Points
1. **Proximity/Commute Information:** Collect anonymized worker zip codes or travel times to facilities.  
2. **Facility-Worker Familiarity Scores:** Record how frequently a worker has claimed shifts at the same facility, plus qualitative feedback on experiences.  
3. **Shift Decline Reasons:** Track specific reasons for declining or withdrawing from a shift (e.g., commute distance, facility environment, pay dissatisfaction) to understand real-time decision drivers.  
4. **Worker Satisfaction and Burnout Indicators:** Gather self-reported well-being metrics (e.g., short surveys) to detect early signs of fatigue.  
5. **Regional Wage Norms and Cost of Living Metrics:** Overlay local labor market rates, commuting constraints, and standard of living indexes.

### B. Methods for Collecting Data
- **In-Platform Surveys**: Quick pulse checks or shift-rating prompts triggered upon shift completion or decline.  
- **Geo-Data Integration**: (With consent) Approximate location data to calculate average commute times and correlate with fill behavior.  
- **External Labor Market Feeds**: Integrate publicly available wage averages and cost-of-living indices for each region.  
- **Facility Relationship Tracking**: Aggregate each worker’s history with a facility (frequency, feedback, shift complexity).

### C. Complement to Existing Analysis
- **Enhanced Segmentation Accuracy**: The above data will help refine the classification of “Core Committed,” “Opportunistic,” etc., by considering location affinity and facility relationships.  
- **Early Burnout Detection**: Data on declining shifts matched with self-reported well-being can be used to forecast attrition risk.  
- **Local Strategy Optimization**: Combining wage norms with commute data reveals where targeted pay adjustments or non-pay incentives would be most effective.

# 3. Validation Approaches

### A. Confirming Key Insights
- **Multivariate Regression Models**  
  - Include new features (facility familiarity, commute distance) to see if they significantly improve predictability of fill rates and worker retention.  
- **Time-Series Analysis**  
  - For repeated measures data, track how changes in pay thresholds or facility relationships affect fill patterns over sequential weeks or months.  
- **Segmentation Shift Profiles**  
  - Examine transition matrices showing how often workers move from “Core Committed” to “Opportunistic Fillers,” confirming whether these shifts correlate with pay spikes or schedule conflicts.

### B. Causality vs. Correlation
- **Propensity Score Matching**  
  - Compare workers with similar baseline characteristics but different levels of facility familiarity or pay exposure to see if variations in fill behavior remain.  
- **Instrumental Variables (IV)**  
  - Use local events (e.g., facility renovations, regional policy changes) as instruments to isolate the effect of non-pay factors on shift claiming.  
- **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)**  
  - For facilities that implement different pay or scheduling policies, compare outcome changes against similar facilities that did not.

# 4. Limited Experiments

(To remain ≤ 1/3 of total response)

### A. Experiment 1: Refined Labeling and Segmentation Pilot
- **Hypothesis:** Deploying a more granular performance-tier labeling system will yield improved prediction of fill rates and reduce confusion around top performers.  
- **Design:**  
  1. Select a representative subset of workers in a few regions.  
  2. Implement revised segment definitions based on actual fill frequency, reliability, and shift length.  
  3. Track predictive accuracy of fill rates vs. control regions still using the “Power Worker” label.  
- **Measurement:**  
  - Compare forecast errors (actual fill vs. predicted) pre- and post-segmentation change.  
  - Monitor worker reaction via short surveys to gauge if the new labels/incentives are well-received.

### B. Experiment 2: Localized Engagement Strategy
- **Hypothesis:** Offering region-specific incentives (e.g., short-commute stipends, facility loyalty bonuses) can improve fill rates more efficiently than across-the-board pay hikes.  
- **Design:**  
  1. Identify two comparable regions with moderate fill challenges.  
  2. In one region, introduce small commute/loyalty bonuses tied to facility familiarity.  
  3. In the other region, run a flat pay raise.  
- **Measurement:**  
  - Compare fill rate improvements, shift coverage times, worker retention, and total cost per filled shift across the two regions.

### C. Experiment 3: Early Intervention for Core Burnout
- **Hypothesis:** Real-time intervention (like stress management tools or flexible scheduling) triggered by over-reliance metrics will reduce attrition among core contributors.  
- **Design:**  
  1. Implement real-time dashboards showing each “Core Committed” worker’s shift frequency in selected facilities.  
  2. Once a worker exceeds a certain threshold, auto-trigger small perks (e.g., extra break time, well-being check-ins).  
- **Measurement:**  
  - Compare turnover rates and shift acceptance among the pilot group vs. a control group without interventions.

# 5. Counter-Hypothesis Testing

### A. Alternative Explanations for Observed Patterns
1. **External Labor Shortages or Surpluses**  
   - It may be that broader staffing challenges (e.g., local hospital expansions, new competitor platforms) rather than platform-specific dynamics drive segment behavior.  
2. **Worker Lifestyle Changes**  
   - Sudden changes in fill rates could be due to personal life events (family needs, external job offers) rather than marketplace factors.  
3. **Systemic Data Mislabeling Beyond “Power Worker” Issues**  
   - There might be other labeling inconsistencies or incomplete data fields contributing to misleading insights.

### B. Methods to Rule Out or Confirm Alternatives
- **Cross-Platform Comparison:** Compare worker engagement behaviors across multiple competing platforms if possible, to see if patterns are platform-specific or market-wide.  
- **Qualitative Interviews:** Conduct targeted interviews or focus groups with workers showing abrupt engagement changes to understand whether life events or marketplace factors played a bigger role.  
- **Data Quality Audits:** Perform routine checks on labeling procedures, ensuring that naming or classification changes are consistently applied and that no large data gaps exist.

### C. Bridging Toward Potential Implementations (≤ 15% of Total)
- **Refinement of Marketplace Tools:** Use validated insights to design more nuanced shift-posting algorithms. For instance, incorporate “facility familiarity” as a top-tier factor when recommending shifts to workers.  
- **Adaptive Rate and Scheduling Policies:** If further research confirms that certain “micro-markets” rely on relationship factors more than pay, shift the priority to community-building incentives over repeated wage hikes.  
- **Proactive Engagement for Core Workers:** Should data confirm that early intervention effectively mitigates burnout, scale up these interventions platform-wide. Focus on consistent recognition of reliable contributors alongside flexible scheduling options.  
- **Customized Onboarding and Retention Tactics:** If data verifies that segment transitions are fluid, tailor onboarding modules to highlight multiple work styles, encouraging more stable coverage while respecting personal preferences.

By critically examining these counter-explanations and bridging the validated findings into targeted pilot implementations, the platform can move beyond assumptions, address root causes of unstable shifts, and improve both worker satisfaction and facility coverage.
