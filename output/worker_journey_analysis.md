## 1. Worker Journey Map

Below is a high-level map of the typical worker lifecycle in this healthcare staffing marketplace. Each phase highlights specific milestones, timeframes, and decision points that impact overall worker retention and activity.

### 1.1 Key Phases
1. Acquisition → 2. Onboarding → 3. Initial Exploration → 4. First Claim → 5. Regular Engagement → 6. Retention/Growth → 7. Dormancy/Win-back

### 1.2 Critical Milestones & Decision Points
- Account Registration: Worker decides to create an account.   
- Profile Completion: Worker uploads credentials, sets preferences, and completes onboarding steps.

- First Claim: Worker commits to a shift (major milestone correlating strongly with long-term retention).  
- Shift Completion: Worker successfully completes the first shift, logs hours, and receives payment.  
- Ongoing Engagement: Worker reviews new postings regularly and claims additional shifts or becomes dormant.  
- Retention/Churn Decision: Worker either remains active, slows claiming, or drops off the platform.  
- Win-back Attempt: Marketplace attempts to re-engage workers who have gone dormant.

### 1.3 Typical Timeframes (Approximate)
- Median Days to First Claim: ~14.4 days from registration.  
- Median Views before Claiming: ~10 shift views before first claim.  
- Time to Dormancy: Varies; risk increases if no new claims occur within 30 days of last completed shift.

### 1.4 Success Metrics
- Registration-to-Onboarding Completion Rate  
- First-Shift Claim Rate  
- Claim-to-Completion Rate (currently ~94.37%)

## 2. Acquisition & Onboarding

Acquisition and onboarding set the tone for worker engagement. Data indicates that 87% of registered workers never claim a shift, underscoring a significant opportunity to refine these early steps.

### 2.1 Key Friction Points
1. Long Onboarding Processes: Workers may lose motivation if uploading credentials, compliance documents, or other onboarding steps feel cumbersome.  
2. Misaligned Expectations: Workers may not see shift options immediately or find the pay rates/locations they expected.  
3. Marketplace “Noise”: Offers in off-peak or less desirable times/locations may confuse new workers and discourage first claims.

### 2.2 Critical First Experiences that Impact Retention
- Receiving a straightforward overview of how to claim and complete shifts.  
- Quickly discovering shifts within desired specialties or schedules.  
- Experiencing transparent pay details, scheduling, and facility-specific info.

### 2.3 Recommended Interventions
1. Streamlined Onboarding Wizard:  
   • Guide workers step-by-step (credential upload, preferences, location settings).  
   • Provide real-time progress indicators and targeted tips to reduce drop-off.  
2. “First-Shift” Concierge Support:  
   • Offer live or in-app chat assistance to help newly onboarded workers find and claim an initial shift.  
   • Provide personalized shift recommendations quickly to reduce “time-to-claim.”  
3. Onboarding Incentives:  
   • Offer a sign-on or “first-claim” bonus to encourage prompt engagement.  
   • Shorten the median time from registration to first claim (currently ~14.4 days).  
4. Clear, Quick “How It Works” Tutorials:  
   • Short videos or guided app tours highlighting easy shift-claim steps.  
   • Display success stories or testimonials from existing high-volume workers.

### 2.4 Success Metrics for Acquisition Optimization
- Completion Rate of Onboarding Steps  
- Time from Registration to First Shift Claim  
- % of Workers Claiming a Shift within 7 Days of Sign-up  
- Drop-off Rate between Registration and First Claim

## 3. Engagement & Activity

After onboarding, keeping workers engaged over time is crucial. Workers typically fall into identifiable segments (e.g., High-Volume Regulars vs. Selective Pickers). Tailored engagement strategies can yield better fill rates and retention.

### 3.1 Factors Driving Regular Engagement
1. Shift Availability & Relevancy: Workers are more inclined to be active if shifts match their location, specialty, and preferred schedule.  
2. Competitive Pay & Incentives: Dynamic pay strategies that reflect supply-demand conditions can motivate quick claims.  
3. Positive Early Experiences: High personal satisfaction (e.g., a smooth facility check-in, prompt payment) fosters repeat claims.  
4. Schedule Predictability: Consistent or reliable access to certain shifts (e.g., night/weekend) helps encourage routine usage.

### 3.2 Warning Signs of Potential Disengagement
- Drop in Log-ins or App Sessions: Fewer sign-ins might predict upcoming churn.  
- Delayed Response to Offers: Longer times to claim can signal lower engagement or dissatisfaction with pay.  
- Higher Cancellation Risk: Rising cancellation rates might indicate mounting dissatisfaction or scheduling conflicts.  

### 3.3 Recommended Interventions to Increase Activity
1. Targeted In-App Notifications:  
   • Alert workers about relevant new shifts at times historically conducive to claiming (e.g., best hours around 22:00).  
   • Use “smart push” to highlight top-paying or urgent shifts.  
2. Personalization & Dynamic Pricing:  
   • Offer pay “boosts” in real-time if shifts go unclaimed.  
   • Provide recommended shifts matched to previous claim history or specialty.  
3. Micro-Recognition & Badges:  
   • Acknowledge milestone shifts (e.g., 5th shift, 10th shift) to reinforce input.  
   • Recognize high completion rates and low cancellations to build worker pride.  
4. Activity Score Tracking:  
   • Track a rolling “engagement score” per worker (log-ins, shift views, claims) to trigger proactive outreach when scores dip.  

### 3.4 Segment-Specific Engagement Strategies
- High-Volume Regulars (Top 20%): Offer loyalty perks, shift priority, or early-bird access.  
- Selective Pickers: Provide fewer, highly customized shift recommendations that meet their specific criteria.  
- Occasional Volunteers: Encourage them with flexible scheduling and highlight open shifts that fit busy lifestyles.  
- Dormant Workers: Recommend the simplest or highest-paying opportunities to re-attract interest.

## 4. Retention & Growth

Retention involves continuously engaging the existing worker base and reducing churn. With a completion rate above 94% and cancellation rate under 4%, those who do claim shifts generally stay reliable. The biggest challenge remains converting the large proportion of never-claim workers.

### 4.1 Key Retention Predictors & Warning Signs
- Frequency of Shift Claims: Workers who steadily claim shifts demonstrate ongoing commitment.  
- Time Since Last Claim: Longer gaps often correlate with an increased churn risk.  
- Satisfaction with Payment & Scheduling: Workers who perceive pay to be fair and scheduling consistent remain longer.  

### 4.2 Critical Experiences that Impact Churn Probability
- Pay Discrepancies or Late Payments: Delays or errors in wages can erode trust.  
- Poor Facility Experience: Negative feedback about a particular location or supervisor can harm engagement across the platform.  
- Overemphasis on Low-Paying Shifts: Persistently offering below-market wages can drive workers away.

### 4.3 Recommended Interventions at Retention Risk Points
1. Real-Time Feedback & Issue Resolution:  
   • Post-shift surveys and quick responses to worker concerns.  
   • Immediate support for payment or facility-related issues.  
2. Proactive Outreach for Low-Engagement Workers:  
   • Automated email or SMS reminders if no new claims in 14 days.  
   • Personalized messages about new shift opportunities or bonuses.  
3. Tiered Rewards Program:  
   • Provide incremental rewards or bonuses for every “X” number of shifts completed.  
   • Offer scheduling flexibility, premium shift notifications, or pay enhancements for long-tenured workers.  

### 4.4 Strategies for Increasing Worker Lifetime Value
- Cross-Specialty Training: Encourage workers to qualify for additional unit types or skill sets to access more shifts.  
- Ongoing Communication: Monthly “state of the marketplace” updates with a summary of new features, top-paying shifts, or upcoming busy seasons.  
- Community Building: Virtual or in-person meetups for healthcare workers to share experiences and strengthen loyalty.

## 5. Resurrection & Win-back

Even with strong engagement, some workers inevitably become dormant. Leveraging a structured win-back strategy can recover lost or inactive workers who may still benefit from the marketplace.

### 5.1 Opportunities to Re-engage Dormant Workers
- Seasonal Spikes: Target outreach before known high-demand periods (e.g., flu season) or holidays to entice re-engagement.  
- Pay or Bonus Incentives: Re-engagement campaigns with limited-time bonus payouts for returning workers.  
- Shift Notifications: Highlight newly available or updated premium shifts.

### 5.2 Most Effective Win-back Strategies  
1. Customized Email/SMS Campaigns:  
   • Personalized subject lines referencing their last completed shift or last date of activity.  
   • Emphasize relevant or higher-paying opportunities.  
2. “We Miss You” Promotions:  
   • One-time pay boost or travel stipend to encourage them to try the platform again.  
   • Offer short refresher on platform updates if user interface changed.  
3. Facility-Specific Invitations:  
   • For those who worked at a particular location, highlight new shifts or improved pay at the same facility.

### 5.3 Prioritization Framework for Resurrection Efforts
- Target “Qualified Dormant” First: Workers with historically high completion rates who promised reliability.  
- Focus on Medium-Term Dormant: Typically those who have been inactive for 30–90 days show higher re-engagement potential than extremely long-term inactive users.  
- Segment by Historical Pay Sensitivity: If workers typically only claimed above a certain rate, tailor offers to match or exceed old rates.

### 5.4 Success Metrics for Resurrection Campaigns
- Open/Click-Through Rates for Win-back Emails  
- Re-activation Rate (claimed a new shift within 30 days of campaign)  
- Idle-to-Active Conversion Rate (percentage of dormant workers who accept a shift after an offer)  
- Sustained Post-Resurrection Activity (ongoing claims)

## Putting it All Together: Recommended Actions by Phase

Below is a concise summary of actionable interventions and considerations for implementation at each major phase:

1) Acquisition & Onboarding  
   • Streamline credentialing.  
   • Provide a dedicated “first-shift” concierge or tutorial.  
   • Encourage quick first claims with targeted bonuses.  

2) Early Engagement  
   • Personalize shift recommendations based on skill, location, and shift preferences.  
   • Send timely notifications during peak claim hours (e.g., 22:00) and days (Tuesday).  
   • Use short quizzes or surveys to refine worker interest.  

3) Ongoing Engagement & Activity  
   • Implement an engagement scoring system to detect declining activity.  
   • Offer micro-recognition (badges, milestone rewards).  
   • Adjust dynamic pay for underserved shifts to encourage quick fills.  

4) Retention & Growth  
   • Introduce a tiered loyalty program (e.g., silver/gold/platinum worker status).  
   • Cultivate community (virtual events, success spotlights).  
   • Maintain rapid issue resolution, especially around payment.  

5) Dormancy & Resurrection  
   • Launch re-engagement campaigns with personalized pay boosters or shift invitations.  
   • Provide a “what’s new” platform update for returning users.  
   • Prioritize dormancy segments with historically strong completion and satisfaction metrics.

By strategically targeting each phase in the worker journey—focusing especially on that critical first-claim hurdle—these interventions aim to strengthen overall worker retention, fill rates, and marketplace liquidity. Consistent monitoring of key metrics (time to first claim, churn rate, engagement score) will further allow for iterative improvements in the worker experience.
