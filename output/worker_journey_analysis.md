## 2. Acquisition & Onboarding

### Key Friction Points
1. Complex or lengthy credentialing/verification processes can discourage new workers.  
2. Unclear platform instructions or insufficient training on shift-claiming mechanics.  
3. Potential mismatch between worker expectations (pay rate, location, shift type) and real marketplace availability.  

### Critical First Experiences
1. Positive sign-up flow: A smooth and quick registration fosters trust.  
2. Straightforward platform introduction: Clear tutorials or guided demos for how to find and claim shifts.  
3. Fast first-win: Guidance toward the first successful claim within ~14 days to reduce drop-off.  

### Recommended Interventions
1. Streamlined Credentialing & Onboarding  
   • Automated document verification to reduce wait times.  
   • Checklists with real-time updates (e.g., “You’re 75% done with setup!”).  
2. Early Shift Matching & Recommendations  
   • Personalized shift recommendations based on location, preferred hours, or job type.  
   • In-app “first-shift offer” or a bonus for completing the first shift within 14 days.  
3. New Worker Orientation & Mentorship  
   • On-platform tutorials or navigation helpers.  
   • Option to connect with a “veteran” worker for Q&A (a part of the “Core Committed” segment).  

### Success Metrics for Acquisition Optimization
• Registration completion rate.  
• Onboarding completion rate (including verification steps).  
• Time to first claim (target: <14 days).  
• First shift completion satisfaction score (target: >90%).

## 3. Engagement & Activity

### Factors Driving Regular Engagement
1. Shift Availability & Fit: Workers regularly returning find enough shifts that match their schedule, pay preferences, and skillset.  
2. Clear Rewards & Incentives: Visible benefit for steady participation (e.g., loyalty perks, higher pay tiers).  
3. Positive Workplace Interactions: Good experiences at worksites (smooth check-in, fair feedback, timely payment).  

### Warning Signs of Potential Disengagement
1. Decline in Claim Rate: If a worker’s claim frequency drops below their previous average.  
2. Spike in Cancellations or No-shows: Indicates dissatisfaction or scheduling conflicts.  
3. Reduced Logins or Platform Activity: Fewer interactions with job postings or the mobile app.  

### Recommended Interventions to Increase Activity
1. Automated Re-Engagement Prompts  
   • Push notifications or email nudges reminding workers of open shifts that match their past preferences—especially around their “best claim hours” (e.g., 10 PM).  
   • Time-sensitive promotions (e.g., “Claim a shift by Friday for 10% premium!”).  
2. Personalized Shift Bundling  
   • Suggest back-to-back shifts at the same location or near each other to maximize earning potential.  
   • Tailor shift bundles to reduce travel time and friction.  
3. Social Proof & Community Building  
   • Show worker testimonials (especially from the “Core Committed” segment).  
   • Foster online communities or forums to discuss tips, share updates, and build camaraderie.  
4. Tiered Benefits/Recognition  
   • Public or in-app recognition for consistent performance—e.g., “Gold Worker” status.  
   • Unlock higher pay tiers or priority claim access for meeting certain completion milestones.  

### Segment-Specific Engagement Strategies
• “Core Committed” (High Claim & Completion):  
  - Offer advanced platform features (priority access to high-paying shifts).  
  - Provide year-end recognition or bonuses.  
• “Casual” or Low-Frequency Workers:  
  - Highlight convenience factors (flexible shifts close to home).  
  - Actionable push notifications with curated shift lists.

## 4. Retention & Growth

### Key Retention Predictors & Warning Signs
1. Time to First Claim: Longer timeframes before the first claim are correlated with higher churn.  
2. Cancellation Rate: A rise in cancellations can quickly lead to loss of platform trust and quitting.  
3. Engagement Frequency: Consistent, moderate claim activity predicts higher long-term retention.  

### Critical Experiences Impacting Churn Probability
1. Payment Issues or Delays: Late or disputed payments can drive dissatisfaction.  
2. Poor Workplace Experiences: Negative on-site interactions or confusing check-in processes.  
3. Competition from Other Platforms: If alternative platforms offer higher pay or simpler scheduling.  

### Recommended Interventions at Retention Risk Points
1. Proactive Support Outreach  
   • Automated triggers when cancellation rate spikes or claim frequency dips—prompt support to identify issues.  
   • Quick resolution of payment or shift-related disputes.  
2. Customized Worker Journeys  
   • Data-driven triggers that offer special incentives or relevant shift recommendations if usage declines.  
   • Personalized “re-training” modules or refreshers to rebuild confidence in the platform if they have cancellations or no-shows.  
3. Flexible Rewards Structure  
   • Small pay boosts for each consecutive shift completed with zero cancellations.  
   • “Milestone bonuses” at shift #5, #10, #25, etc., to celebrate achievements.  

### Strategies for Increasing Worker Lifetime Value
1. Ongoing Skills Development: Offer training or certifications that can lead to higher-paying shifts.  
2. Gamification & Progress Tracking: Show progress bars or dashboards indicating the worker’s earnings, shift history, and upcoming “Tier Up” opportunities.  
3. Regular Surveys & Feedback Loops: Solicit and act on worker feedback to continuously improve shift conditions and platform features.

## 5. Resurrection & Win-Back

### Opportunities to Re-engage Dormant Workers
1. Inactivity Windows: Identify workers with no claims in the past 30/60 days.  
2. Seasonal or Market Demand Surges: Times of high shift availability present an ideal moment for targeted campaigns.  

### Most Effective Win-Back Strategies
1. Personalized Outreach  
   • Tailored messages that highlight how many shifts are available in their preferred locations or times.  
   • Include a “Reactivation Bonus” or reduced platform fees upon returning.  
2. Simplified Re-Onboarding  
   • If credentials have expired, provide easy, step-by-step re-verification instructions.  
   • Offer quick refresher tutorials on any new platform features introduced since they left.  
3. Real-Time Labor Market Insights  
   • Show updated pay rates, newly available shift types, or trending demand to illustrate new opportunities.  

### Prioritization Framework for Resurrection Efforts
• High-Potential Dormant Workers  
  - Previously high claim or completion rates.  
  - Proactive outreach with personalized incentives.  
• Occasional Users  
  - Might respond to targeted convenience-based offers (e.g., shifts near them).  
• Low-Engagement or Problematic Workers  
  - Evaluate if reactivation is worth the effort (high cancellation/no-show history may not offer positive ROI).  

### Success Metrics for Resurrection Campaigns
• Reactivation Rate (30/60/90-day)  
• Post-Reactivate Claim Frequency  
• Post-Reactivate Cancellation Rate  
• Overall ROI of reactivation incentives
