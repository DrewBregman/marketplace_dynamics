## 1. Worker Journey Map

### Key Phases in the Worker Lifecycle

1. Awareness & Registration  
   • Worker becomes aware of the platform, signs up, and provides basic details.  
   • Key milestone: Completed registration.  
   • Typical timeframe: Day 0 (registration date).

2. Profile Setup & Verification  
   • Worker completes profile information (credentials, preferences) and any platform-required verification.  
   • Key milestone: First sign-in after registration, verified profile.  
   • Typical timeframe: Day 1–7, depending on verification requirements.

3. Initial Exploration & Shift Viewing  
   • Worker browses available shifts, assesses compensation, location, hours, and personal fit.  
   • Key milestone: Worker’s first shift view(s).  
   • Typical timeframe: Day 1–14 (median 10 shift views before first claim).

4. First Claim & Onboarding Completion  
   • Worker claims their first shift. This is the single largest leap in platform engagement.  
   • Key milestone: First claimed shift (median is ~14 days from registration).  
   • Typical timeframe: Up to ~2 weeks to claim (on average).

5. Active Engagement & Ongoing Activity  
   • Worker repeatedly checks for shifts, claims shifts, completes them, and potentially cancels some.  
   • Key milestone: Consistent claiming behavior, stable completion rate.  
   • Typical timeframe: From first claim onward, with average completion rate ~94%.

6. Growth & Loyalty (High-Volume Regulars)  
   • Top-performing workers who repeatedly fill shifts, driving marketplace reliability.  
   • Key milestone: Establishment of stable, repeatable work patterns and strong contribution to fill rates.  
   • Typical timeframe: Varies widely (long-term engaged workers).

7. Warning Signs & Potential Disengagement  
   • Decreasing frequency of shift claims or extended periods of inactivity.  
   • Key milestone: No claimed shifts for >30 days (churn threshold).  
   • Typical timeframe: After ~30 days of inactivity.

8. Dormancy & Churn  
   • Worker fully ceases to claim or complete shifts for a prolonged period (>30 days).  
   • Key milestone: Inactive status exceeding churn threshold.  

### Critical Milestones & Decision Points
• Registration → Profile Setup (decision: continue completing sign-up or abandon).  
• First Claim (decision: whether to claim at all, which shift to claim).  
• Continued Claiming (decision: remain active or drop off if the experience isn’t positive).  

### Typical Timeframes
• Registration & Profile Setup: Day 0–7.  
• Exploration & First Claim: Day 1–14 (with a median of 14 days to claim).  
• Shift Completion & Repeat Claims: Ongoing after initial claim.  
• Churn Checkpoint: ~30 days of no activity.

### Success Metrics by Phase
• Registration & Profile Setup: % completing profile, time to verification.  
• Initial Exploration: Views-to-first-claim conversion, days to first claim.  
• Active Engagement: Claim frequency, completion rate, cancellation rate.  
• Growth & Loyalty: % of workers who become high-volume regulars, fill rate contribution.  
• Warning Signs & Churn: % of workers disengaging within 30 days, time in between claims.

## 2. Acquisition & Onboarding

### Key Friction Points During Worker Acquisition
• Confusing or lengthy sign-up flows may deter full profile completion.  
• Lack of clarity on verification steps or required credentials could delay initial engagement.  
• Potential mismatch between worker expectations (e.g., desired shift hours) and actual marketplace availability.

### Critical First Experiences That Impact Retention
• Time-to-first-claim is crucial: the median of 14 days suggests many postpone their first claim.  
• If relevant shifts are not immediately visible, workers may drop off or forget the platform.  
• Early cancellations or confusing shift details (e.g., wage changes or location confusion) reduce trust.

### Recommended Interventions to Improve Onboarding
1. Streamlined Registration & Profile Completion  
   • Short, step-by-step wizard with progress bars and clear instructions.  
   • Immediate feedback on verification status (e.g., “Your background check is 80% complete”).  

2. Proactive First-Shift Nudges  
   • Automated reminders after registration (“Explore shifts near you,” “Claim your first shift reward”).  
   • Personalized shift recommendations based on location and schedule preferences.

3. First-Shift Incentives  
   • One-time bonus or guaranteed minimum pay for first completed shift.  
   • Gamified milestone badge for the first shift, motivating next claims.

4. Onboarding Tutorial or Buddy System  
   • Interactive tutorial explaining how to claim, what to expect on shift day, cancellation policies.  
   • “Buddy shift” concept pairing a new worker with an experienced worker, easing first-shift nerves.

### Success Metrics for Acquisition Optimization
• Registration Completion Rate: % of sign-ups that complete full profile.  
• Days to Verification Completion: Speed of moving workers through compliance checks.  
• Days/View Count to First Claim: Shortening the median time from sign-up to first claimed shift.  
• Cost per Acquired Worker vs. Activation Rate.

## 3. Engagement & Activity

### Factors Driving Regular Engagement
• Sufficient volume & variety of shifts posted (times, locations, pay rates).  
• Positive experience from previous shifts (smooth check-in, fair pay, easy cancellations if needed).  
• Responsive communication: timely notifications of newly posted shifts, shift updates, or price changes.

### Warning Signs of Potential Disengagement
• Declining claim frequency, especially if the worker once actively claimed.  
• Increasing cancellation rate, indicating dissatisfaction or scheduling conflicts.  
• Extended inactivity beyond 14–30 days after initial claim.

### Recommended Interventions to Increase Activity

1. Tailored Shift Notifications  
   • Target workers’ preferred hours (e.g., 22:00 for the best claim rate) and days (Tuesday highest claim rate).  
   • Use push or SMS alerts linked to the worker’s typical availability window.

2. Tiered Rewards & Loyalty Programs  
   • Offer premium perks (priority access to high-paying shifts, peer recognition) for high-frequency workers.  
   • Provide completion streak bonuses (e.g., complete 5 shifts in a month = pay boost or gift card).

3. Dynamic Shift Pricing  
   • Offer real-time wage boosts for unfilled shifts (e.g., weekend or midday low-demand hours) that align with worker preferences.  
   • Highlight surge pricing in notifications during critical shift-filling windows.

4. Role-Specific or Specialty Training  
   • Offer advanced or specialized certifications that unlock higher-paying or more interesting shifts.  
   • Encourages skill development and commitment to the platform.

### Segment-Specific Engagement Strategies

• High-Volume Regulars (Top 20%)  
  – Ensure they have consistent shift options to avoid burnout.  
  – Provide recognition (digital badges, profile highlighting) and loyalty incentives.  

• Selective Pickers  
  – Personalized shift match filters (focusing on pay rates, skill set, or location).  
  – Occasional bonus for picking “less desirable shifts” to increase engagement variety.  

• Infrequent or New Workers  
  – Frequent nudges about available shifts that match their schedule.  
  – Lower friction to claim (one-click claim flow, minimal extra steps).

## 4. Retention & Growth

### Key Retention Predictors and Warning Signs
• Regular claiming intervals: Workers whose intervals between claims grow are at higher churn risk.  
• Cancel-to-claim ratio spikes: Indicate growing dissatisfaction or scheduling conflicts.  
• Engagement with platform communications: Lower open rates for shift notifications often precede drop-off.

### Critical Experiences that Impact Churn Probability
• Troublesome or unfulfilled first shift experiences (e.g., repeated reassignments, confusing pay changes).  
• Lack of shift variety matching a worker’s availability or pay expectations.  
• Inconsistent platform support (slow resolution of disputes, delayed pay, unclear rules).

### Recommended Interventions at Retention Risk Points

1. Proactive Comms for At-Risk Workers  
   • Automated email or SMS when a worker’s claim frequency drops significantly.  
   • Personalized offers (e.g., a small pay boost on their next shift) or re-engagement coaching.

2. Cancellations Follow-Up  
   • Quick check-in on reasons for cancellation. Provide alternative shifts or extended scheduling options.  
   • Offer flexible solutions (shorter shift segments, different location) to reduce friction.

3. Seasonal & Surge Strategies  
   • Email campaigns highlighting upcoming busy seasons with bonus pay potential.  
   • “Limited-time offer” shift promotions to spike interest during low-demand times.

4. High-Value Worker Retention Program  
   • Dedicated account manager or specialized support for top 20% claimers.  
   • Exclusive training, advanced certifications, or platform events to deepen loyalty.

### Strategies for Increasing Worker Lifetime Value
• Diversify shift opportunities (department variety, cross-facility postings) so workers can expand skill sets.  
• Gamify progress (levels or tiers) that unlock better pay or benefits over time.  
• Encourage direct feedback loops (in-app reviews of shift experience, transparent rating system).

## 5. Resurrection & Win-back

### Opportunities to Re-Engage Dormant Workers
• Worker re-engagement often has high ROI, especially if they were previously active.  
• Many workers (87% who never claimed) represent an untapped or dormant pool. Reignite interest with targeted campaigns.

### Most Effective Win-Back Strategies

1. Personalized Messaging  
   • Remind dormant workers of the platform’s value, highlight new features or improvements since last login.  
   • Offer a curated list of open shifts matching their typical availability.

2. “Welcome Back” Incentive  
   • Limited-time bonus for completing a shift within X days of returning to the platform.  
   • Staged re-onboarding tutorial to refresh knowledge.

3. Mobile Push & Email Drip  
   • Automated sequences specifically targeting workers who haven’t logged in for 30+ days.  
   • Showcase compelling shift stories (e.g., “Workers earned up to 20% more this month”).

### Prioritization Framework for Resurrection Efforts
• Focus first on moderately dormant workers (inactive for 30–60 days) who showed prior interest (claimed at least 1–5 shifts).  
• Use segmented messaging for “never claimed” vs. “active then dormant.”

### Success Metrics for Resurrection Campaigns
• Re-activation Rate: Proportion of dormant workers who claim a shift after outreach.  
• Post-Resurrection Engagement: Claim frequency and subsequent retention after returning.  
• Cost-Effectiveness: Marketing spend vs. incremental shifts filled by resurrected workers.
