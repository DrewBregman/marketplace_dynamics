Worker attributes
- Acceptance / Claim Rate (how many shift offers did the worker view vs. how many they claimed)
- Identifying power workers by net earnings

- Do workers tend to pick up shifts more often if they view them in the mornings vs. late at night?
- Differences in claim behavior by new vs. experienced workers

- fill rate by workplace (of all shifts posted, how many were eventually claimed and worked)
- worker stickiness point

Worker-Side Metrics

Activation Threshold - Similar to the stickiness point, how many shifts must a worker successfully complete before becoming a regular user? This could be measured by looking at retention after X completed shifts.
Price Sensitivity Curve - How does booking likelihood change with different rate offers? Is there a "psychological threshold" where acceptance rates jump significantly?
Time-to-First-Booking - How quickly after viewing offers do new workers make their first booking? Shorter windows likely indicate higher future engagement.
Shift Type Preference Strength - Do workers who book specific shift types (e.g., NOC shifts) repeatedly show higher retention? This could reveal preference formation.
Cancellation Behaviors - Is there a "cancellation threshold" where workers who cancel more than X times are unlikely to return to the platform?

Workplace-Side Metrics

Workplace Stickiness Point - How many successful shifts must be filled before a workplace becomes a regular poster?
Rate Experimentation Window - Do workplaces that adjust rates within the first X postings tend to have better long-term outcomes?
Deletion Pattern Impact - How do shift deletions affect future worker engagement with that workplace?

Marketplace Dynamics

Network Effect Indicators - Can you measure when the "flywheel" starts turning in specific geographies? Look for acceleration in bookings per worker/workplace.
Trust-Building Cycle - How many successful transactions between the same worker-workplace pair creates "loyalty"?
Peak-End Rule Analysis - Do workers who experience their highest pay rate in their last few shifts have higher retention?
IKEA Effect - Do workers who invest more time browsing before booking have higher completion rates? (The IKEA effect suggests people value things more when they put effort into obtaining them)
Loss Aversion Signals - Are workers more likely to book shifts after losing out on previously viewed opportunities?
Choice Paralysis Thresholds - Is there a point where too many shift options actually decreases booking rates?
Anchoring Effects - Do initial rate offers set expectations that influence future booking decisions?
Default Bias - Are workers more likely to accept recommended shifts versus ones they discover through browsing?
Scarcity Effects - Do "almost filled" shifts or "limited time" offers drive quicker booking decisions?
Social Proof Points - If you have data on how workers are referred, do those who join through referrals reach stickiness faster?


Status Quo Premium - Calculate the rate increase required to make workers switch from their established workplace/shift patterns.

Burnout Prediction Indicators - Sequential shift patterns that predict worker churn or extended platform absence.

Vacancy Chain Effects - When a worker cancels, track the ripple effects through replacement workers and their subsequent behavior.

Compensating Differentials - Calculate the implicit "price" workers place on non-monetary factors (shift timing, location proximity, workplace quality).

Two-Part Tariff Behavior - Do workers mentally separate the "cost" of committing to the platform from the benefits of individual shifts?

How would you actually measure these things?

Practical Measurement Approaches
1. Activation Threshold

Count successful shifts completed before a worker shows regular engagement (defined as booking at least one shift per week for 4+ consecutive weeks)
SQL approach: Group workers by number of completed shifts, then calculate retention rates for each group

2. Price Sensitivity Curve

Create rate buckets (e.g., $20-25, $25-30, etc.)
For each worker, calculate booking percentage at different rate levels
Plot booking probability against offered rates
Use regression analysis to find inflection points where behavior changes significantly

3. Time-to-Decision Analysis

Measure time delta between offer_viewed_at and claimed_at
Create cohorts based on decision speed and track their long-term retention

4. Worker Segmentation
CopySELECT 
  worker_id,
  COUNT(shift_id) as total_views,
  SUM(CASE WHEN claimed_at IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as bookings,
  SUM(CASE WHEN is_verified = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as completed_shifts,
  AVG(rate) as avg_rate_viewed,
  AVG(CASE WHEN claimed_at IS NOT NULL THEN rate ELSE NULL END) as avg_rate_booked
FROM shift_offers
GROUP BY worker_id
5. Rate Elasticity Calculation
Copy-- For each worker, calculate booking probability at different rate levels
WITH rate_brackets AS (
  SELECT
    worker_id,
    FLOOR(rate/5)*5 as rate_bracket,
    COUNT(*) as offers_seen,
    SUM(CASE WHEN claimed_at IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as offers_booked
  FROM shift_offers
  GROUP BY worker_id, FLOOR(rate/5)*5
)
SELECT
  worker_id,
  rate_bracket,
  offers_booked::float / offers_seen as booking_probability
FROM rate_brackets
WHERE offers_seen > 5  -- Require minimum sample size
ORDER BY worker_id, rate_bracket
6. Cancellation Threshold

Group workers by cancellation rate
Calculate retention rates for each group to find threshold where retention drops significantly

7. Workplace Stickiness Analysis
CopySELECT
  workplace_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT shift_id) as shifts_posted,
  COUNT(DISTINCT worker_id) as workers_engaged,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN is_verified = TRUE THEN shift_id ELSE NULL END) as shifts_completed
FROM shift_offers
GROUP BY workplace_id
8. Geographic Network Effects

Group data by geographic regions (if available)
Plot growth rates against marketplace density
Look for acceleration points in booking rates as function of total market participants

9. Worker Lifetime Value
Copy-- First, find each worker's platform lifespan
WITH worker_lifespan AS (
  SELECT
    worker_id,
    MIN(offer_viewed_at) as first_activity,
    MAX(COALESCE(shift_start_at, offer_viewed_at)) as last_activity,
    DATE_DIFF('day', MIN(offer_viewed_at), MAX(COALESCE(shift_start_at, offer_viewed_at))) as days_active
  FROM shift_offers
  GROUP BY worker_id
)
-- Then calculate value metrics
SELECT
  w.worker_id,
  w.days_active,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN s.is_verified = TRUE THEN s.shift_id ELSE NULL END) as shifts_completed,
  SUM(CASE WHEN s.is_verified = TRUE THEN s.rate * s.duration ELSE 0 END) as total_earnings,
  -- Marketplace revenue (assuming you know your take rate)
  SUM(CASE WHEN s.is_verified = TRUE THEN (s.charge_rate - s.rate) * s.duration ELSE 0 END) as platform_revenue
FROM worker_lifespan w
JOIN shift_offers s ON w.worker_id = s.worker_id
GROUP BY w.worker_id, w.days_active
10. Decision Fatigue
Copy-- Assign session IDs to viewing periods (views within 30 min of each other)
WITH sessions AS (
  SELECT
    worker_id,
    offer_viewed_at,
    claimed_at,
    canceled_at,
    is_verified,
    -- This assigns sequential numbers within each worker_id partition
    SUM(CASE WHEN DATEDIFF('minute', LAG(offer_viewed_at) OVER(PARTITION BY worker_id ORDER BY offer_viewed_at), 
              offer_viewed_at) > 30 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) 
              OVER(PARTITION BY worker_id ORDER BY offer_viewed_at) as session_id
  FROM shift_offers
)
-- Calculate booking and completion rates by sequence position within session
SELECT
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY worker_id, session_id ORDER BY offer_viewed_at) as view_sequence_in_session,
  COUNT(*) as total_views,
  SUM(CASE WHEN claimed_at IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::float / COUNT(*) as booking_rate,
  SUM(CASE WHEN is_verified = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::float / 
    NULLIF(SUM(CASE WHEN claimed_at IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 0) as completion_rate
FROM sessions
GROUP BY view_sequence_in_session
ORDER BY view_sequence_in_session
11. Status Quo Premium

Identify repeated workplace-worker pairings
Compare accepted rates at familiar vs. new workplaces
Calculate the rate premium required for workers to switch to new workplaces

To actually implement these analyses, I'd recommend:

First perform exploratory analysis to validate data quality
Build a core set of derived metrics tables (worker profiles, shift outcomes)
Create visualization dashboards for the most promising metrics
Run controlled experiments to test hypotheses that emerge from the analysis

Each of these analyses can reveal actionable insights about marketplace behavior that can guide product and pricing decisions.
