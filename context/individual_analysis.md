Clipboard Health’s two-sided healthcare staffing marketplace presents a complex interaction between posted shifts and the workers who fill them. A careful examination of shift offers, worker acceptance patterns, cancellations, no-shows, and pricing sheds light on how well supply meets demand, which facilities struggle to staff reliably, and how pay rates influence behavior. This brief draws on a detailed dataset of shift “offers” (i.e., views with an associated pay rate), analyzing both the worker and workplace sides of the marketplace.

The primary takeaway is that, while a small fraction of “power users” (both workers and facilities) drive the majority of successful matches, there remains enormous untapped potential among workers who have never booked a shift and workplaces with persistent fill-rate challenges. Strategic interventions—such as dynamic pricing, targeted onboarding, and refined scheduling practices—can dramatically improve coverage, reduce cancellations, and bolster retention on both sides.

Below is a concise analysis of the key findings, followed by recommendations for boosting marketplace efficiency and reliability.

Detailed Analysis
1. Worker Behaviors and Engagement
Claim Rates and Timing

The overall claim rate from viewing to booking stands at 4.91%, indicating most viewed shifts go unclaimed. However, once a worker does claim a shift, the data shows an impressive 94%+ completion rate, highlighting that claiming is the hardest step in the funnel.
Time-of-day influences interest: Morning slots see a modest 3.2% claim rate, whereas evenings rise to 6.25%. A spike in successful claims happens around 7–8 PM, underscoring that well-timed notifications and price adjustments could lift booking conversions.
Experienced vs. New Workers

Newly onboarded workers claim shifts around 5.96% of the time, while experienced workers (5+ past shifts) jump to an 18.87% claim rate. This reveals a learning curve: once workers understand the platform and see reliable payouts, they claim more frequently.
Conversely, roughly 87.4% of registered workers never claim a shift at all—an enormous “long tail” of potential supply that, if activated, could substantially improve fill rates.
Cancellations and No-Shows

Although completion is generally high, the minority who do cancel often do so 3–7 days before the shift. Workers who cancel in this window are likelier to churn entirely (i.e., not return within the next 7 days), reflecting a fragile early user experience.
No-call/no-shows (NCNS) remain infrequent, but each unplanned absence undermines facility trust, prompting higher pay demands or earlier cancellations in the future.
First-Shift Hurdle

The median time from first viewing a shift to actually claiming one is 14.4 days, with the median worker needing 10 views before booking.
Workers who book a first shift within a day or two often show far higher long-term retention rates—pointing to the importance of “early success” in hooking new workers.
2. Workplace Dynamics and Fill Rates
Marketplace-Wide Fill Rate

Despite a substantial number of posted shifts, only about 63.56% end up fully filled. Some workplaces surpass 80% coverage, while others fall under 50%, causing recurring staffing challenges.
Power Workplaces

About 20% of workplaces account for over 70% of total shift volume, a concentration that puts the marketplace at risk if a few major facilities reduce postings or leave altogether.
Yet even large, high-volume workplaces can struggle if they set rates too low or post last-minute shifts. When pay is below $18.50 per hour, claim rates plummet below 5%.
Problematic Workplaces

Facilities with consistently low fill rates often share three traits: below-market pay rates, frequent short-notice postings, and a history of higher-than-average cancellations or no-shows. These factors discourage workers from returning, fueling a self-reinforcing cycle of poor coverage and urgent (often more expensive) re-postings.
Interestingly, workers are 1.5 times more willing to accept sub-market pay at a familiar workplace they trust—reinforcing that positive workplace reputations reduce the need for expensive pay raises to fill shifts.
3. Pricing and Payment Insights
Pay Sensitivity

Analysis of shift-level elasticity suggests claim rates respond noticeably to rate increases. A “big” pay bump (over $5/hour) correlates with a 27.5% claim rate (well above the 4.91% baseline).
Two key “psychological” thresholds appear around $20 and $25 per hour, where claim rates jump disproportionately. This indicates that workers react strongly once rates cross these round-number reference points.
Dynamic Pricing Efficacy

Shifts posted well in advance can start at a slightly lower base, then ramp up as the date approaches if unclaimed. The data shows the best time to adjust rates is around 24–48 hours before shift start.
In contrast, multiple small pay increments do not seem as effective as one well-timed, larger boost. Workers often ignore small adjustments, whereas a clear surge captures attention.
Lead Time Effects

Short-notice postings (<24 hours) comprise a large fraction of unfilled shifts. These typically require an urgent pay premium to guarantee coverage.
Longer lead times (>7 days) can yield stable fill rates, but if posted pay is too low, the shift may languish until a last-minute spike in pay occurs.
4. Strategic Observations
Concentration Risks: The top 20% of both workers and workplaces drive the majority of successful matches. The marketplace is vulnerable if either side becomes dissatisfied—worker churn or facility exits could cause sudden dips in fill rate.

Untapped Worker Supply: With 87.4% of workers never having claimed a single shift, focusing on better onboarding and early incentives could drastically expand active supply.

Early Experiences Matter: Workers who quickly claim a first shift are far more likely to keep engaging, highlighting the importance of an intuitive claiming process, transparent pay, and a welcoming workplace.

Pricing as a Lever: Strategic pay adjustments remain the clearest lever to influence short-term fill rates. However, combining dynamic pricing with stable facility conditions and strong user experience proves more sustainable than relying on pay bumps alone.

Reducing Cancellation Loops: High worker cancellations or facility deletions can trigger distrust on both sides. Encouraging longer lead times, implementing moderate penalties, or rewarding shift completion can lessen these disruptions.

Conclusion and Implications
The Clipboard Health marketplace data reveals a delicate balance: a relatively small portion of highly active workers and high-volume workplaces keeps fill rates afloat, yet overall coverage remains below desired levels. Despite a robust platform offering, the majority of signed-up workers never complete even one shift, suggesting deep potential for activation. Meanwhile, workplaces that tailor postings to local wage norms and reasonable lead times see far better fill outcomes than those that chronically underpay or scramble last-minute.

Tangible next steps include:

Revamped Worker Onboarding: Simplify sign-up and reward first-shift claims promptly to reduce the 14-day lag.
Tiered Dynamic Pricing: Use data-driven pay bumps at 24–48 hours pre-shift if needed, especially for roles or time slots prone to low fill rates.
Support for “Problematic” Facilities: Provide best-practice consultations on pay, scheduling, and shift postings; highlight how small operational changes can boost fill rates and reduce cancellations.
Retention-Focused Engagement: Reinforce loyalty programs, highlight reliable workplaces to workers, and maintain a frictionless payment system to keep experienced workers on the platform.
